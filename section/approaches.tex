\section{Approaches}

They are

\begin{itemize}
\item early attempts reviewed in \cite{TQM1, TQM2}, Aharonov-Bohm, Kijowski etc.
\item detector model (Ruschhaupt, Muga) \cite{TQM1, TQM2}
\item
    time ``tensor'' position Hilbert space or ``second'' Schr\"odinger equation (Prvanovic)
\item time and entanglement (Page and Wootters model, Leggett-Garg inequality as \emph{time} version of Bell inequalities, experiments by Moreva, Genovese et al.)
\item approachs where not only spacetime but causality itself is not fundamental (indefinite causal order: Oreshkov, Brukner et al)
\item event-based approaches: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``event'' wavefunction square integrable in 4D (how does it relate rigourously to detector model?)
        \item event-enhanced quantum theory (EEQT, Ruschhaupt et al.)
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
