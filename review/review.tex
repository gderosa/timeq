\section{Blah blah}

Three papers: \cite{Lloyd:Time}, \cite{Marletto:Evolution}, \cite{Prvanovic}.

And an experiment: \cite{Moreva:synthetic}.

The basic idea is an additional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_T$ where time is an observable
corresponding to
a self-adjoint operator whose mathematical properties are the same of position in the
ordinary Hilbert space of a quantum particle in one dimension.

In this language, the ordinary Hilbert space can be labeled $\mathcal{H}_S$;
and we consider the product space $\mathcal{H}_T \otimes \mathcal{H}_S$ as
the space in which both time and position are observables, and they act as
$\hat{t} \otimes \idop_S$ and $\idop_T \otimes \hat{x}$
respectively.
