Time in QM?

## Build
If you have `make` and a full LaTeX installation, just run
```bash
make
```
in the project root directory, and A PDF output document will be generated
under `build/`.

### Cleanup
Cleanup with
```bash
make clean
```

### If you don't have `make` (non-Unix systems etc.)
Look into [`Makefile`](Makefile) to see the underlying command lines you can run (currently based on `latexmx`).
