- the abstract could represent better the content of the thesis
- ~~the proof of proposition 2.2.1 uses a discrete eigenbasis of the 
operator, this could be included in the formulation of the proposition~~
  - &rightarrow; proposition formulation edited
- ~~it is unclear if the example on p.27 has been developed by the author 
or is also part of the review, this should be underlined better~~
  - &rightarrow; added a reference to John Preskill's notes on the first paragraph of the Subsection,
    thus makiing it clear that the exmaples are part of a review of existing literature
- Figure 3.2 (b), is there a specific motivation to look at the 
detection probability in the frequency domain?
- chapter 4: IMPORTANT: the operator Omega is not consistently defined 
in the whole chapter, sometimes H_T = - hbar Omega, sometimes H_T= hbar 
Omega, it is essential that the author chooses one definition and use 
that definition consistently during the whole chapter 4
- IMPORTANT: as the definition of Omega is not consistent in chapter 4, 
it is also not clear if the definition of the Fourier transformation and 
the inverse Fourier transformation is consistent and correctly used in 
Chapter 4; the author should check the consistent definition and correct 
use of the Fourier transformations in Chapter 4
- the calculation shown in eq. (4.41) is not correct and should be 
corrected, in line with this, eqs. (4.42) and (4.43) should be better 
discussed in the text
- p.68: the author should explain in the text why the 40th and 41th 
eigenvectors are used here and not some others, is there no eigenvector 
with eigenvalue 0 is this case?
- Figure 4.1: the figure caption is unclear and need to be improved
- the axis labels of Figs. 4.1, 4.2 are too small
- eq. (4.60) is unclear and should be motivated better
- it should be explained why there is a difference between the numerical 
numbers in eqs. (4.69) and (4.70)
- Figure 4.5, 4.7: the captions need to be extended

There are also minor typos that will be discussed by the internal examiner and the student.
