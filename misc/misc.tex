--- \emph{comment}: time measured and stored here
may be all classical information
so this paper may or may not be relevant for the topic.

But
``prototypes of clocks based on quantum principles,
such as entanglement and squeezing''
may make this interesting again, see reference therein.
They also cite Lloyd, Giovannetti and Maccone,
but a paper quite older then \cite{Lloyd:Time}.
