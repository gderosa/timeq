1703.08036 An experiment to test decoherence under gravity aka entangled photons undergoing different paths and how their entanglement is affected.
``Space QUEST mission proposal: Experimentally testing decoherence due to gravity''.

Are they getting entangled with the environment instead? (Merletto and Vedral).

The theoretical paper behind the space experiment: \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3677.pdf}. Interestingly, it mentions 
\emph{event formalism}, and we thought about that: is an event something
representable as a proper vector in $\mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb{R}^4)$ --- where one of the dimensions is time?
TODO: deepen the event formalism if it's quantum.

Resume ``Quantum Statistical Gravity''? \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05707}.

``Fundamental decoherence from quantum gravity: a pedagogical review''
\url{https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0603090} ---
``fundamental loss of unitarity
that appears in quantum mechanics
due to the use of a physical apparatus to measure time''.

Closed timelike curves are also the subject of a paper by Lloyd (cite!).

``Deutsch argued that
the usual paradoxes associated with such solutions of general
relativity can be resolved by quantum mechanics''  in the reference above. But in the even formalism
\emph{spacetime is still a classical background!}. Event operators a parametrized by $t$\dots
