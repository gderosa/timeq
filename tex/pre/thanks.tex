I've been working towards this Master's degree
while continuing a parallel career
as an IT professional and software engineer.
I want to thank my
colleagues and friends from that industry for their encouragement,
and intellectual curiosity,
about this endeavour.
I also want to thank those managers
who have, in various ways, supported and facilitated~it:
I. Siddiqui, P. Ryan, M. Taylor, N. Raza, P. Kelleher;
A. Ventre;
T. Desmond, S. Sheppard, S. McSherry.

I want to thank my family, and friends, and adored ones back in Italy,
who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic;
nonetheless they have been always present.

Thanks to all my fellow postgraduate students,
as well as research staff,
at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group in UCC.
A special mention to David~Rea.
Above all, I shall acknowledge my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt's immense patience,
his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the way, and many, many other qualities.
Also thanks to all those involved in the teaching lab, for the experience as a
first-year demonstrator that,
if not strictly connected to the topic of this thesis,
does remind me where all modern physics ultimately comes from.

Finally, as there's no Bob without Alice (in any quantum channel),
well,
\emph{Bob} would like to thank \emph{Alice}.
For every time she's up when he's down,
and vice versa.
Their lives may be far apart,
yet wonderfully entangled.
