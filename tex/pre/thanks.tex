Work towards this thesis has been undertaken while my parallel career
as an IT and software engineer has continued,
substantially uninterrupted;
I want to start thanking people at those companies for their support and open mind:
this includes managers like
I.~Siddiqui, P. Ryan, M. Taylor, N. Raza, P. Kelleher, A. Ventre, T. Desmond, S.~Sheppard, S. McSherry;
and a good few exceptional colleagues and friends:
we shared a lot about career, life, interests and passions over the years.

Thanks to my original family, and friends, back in Italy,
who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic.

Thanks to my fellow postgraduate students,
as well as Research Staff,
at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group.
I'm particularly grateful to David Rea.
I shall acknowledge my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt, for his infinite patience,
only to mention his least ``technical'' quality;
and his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the journey.
Thanks to all those involved with the teaching labs at UCC;
the  experience as a  first-year demonstrator may not be stricly related to the topic of this work,
but we should never forget where even the most sophisticated sector of physics
ultimately comes from.

Last but not least ---as there's no Bob without Alice in any thought natural process---
well, Bob would like to thank Alice;
for every time she’s up when he’s down, and vice versa.
Their lives might be far apart, but they believe in entanglement, and in each other.
