  Work towards this thesis has been undertaken while a parallel career
  as an IT and software engineer has continued,
  substantially uninterrupted;
  I want to start thanking people at those companies for their support and open mind:
  this includes managers like
  I.~Siddiqui, P. Ryan, M. Taylor, N. Raza, P. Kelleher, A. Ventre, T. Desmond, S.~Sheppard, S. McSherry;
  and a good few exceptional colleagues and friends:
  we shared a lot about career, life, interests and passions over the years.

  Thanks to my family and friends back in Italy,
  who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic.

  Thanks to my fellow postgraduate students
  as well as research staff
  at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group.
  A special mention to David Rea.
  I shall acknowledge my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt, for his patience,
  only to mention his least ``technical'' quality;
  and his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the journey.

  Last but not least ---as there's no Bob without Alice in any thought experiment---
  well, Bob would like to thank Alice,
  for every time she’s up when he’s down, and vice versa.
  Their lives might be far apart, but they believe in entanglement, and in each other.
