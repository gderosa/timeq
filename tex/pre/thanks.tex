  This work has been completed while continuing a parallel career in the ICT and software engineering industry. I want to thank the relevant managers, who have helped with work flexibility and an open mind: I. Siddiqui, P. Ryan, M. Taylor, N. Raza, P. Kelleher, A. Ventre, T. Desmond, S. Sheppard, S. McSherry.
  I've also had exceptional colleagues and friends over the years:
  we have shared a lot about our dreams and ambitions.
  
  I want to thanks to my family and friends back in Italy,
  who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic.

  Thanks to my fellow postgraduate students
  as well as research staff
  at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group.
  A special mention to David Rea.
  Above all, I shall acknowledge my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt's infinite patience,
  his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the journey, and many, many other qualities.

  Last but not least ---as there's no Bob without Alice in any thought ex\-per\-i\-ment---
  well, Bob would like to thank Alice,
  for every time she’s up when he’s down, and vice versa.
  Their lives might be far apart,
  but entanglement helps.
