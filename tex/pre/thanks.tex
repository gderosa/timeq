Work towards this thesis has been undertaken while a parallel career
in IT and software engineering has continued,
substantially uninterrupted;
I want to start thanking people at those companies, for their support and open mind:
this includes managers like
I.~Siddiqui, P. Ryan, M. Taylor, N. Raza, P. Kelleher, A. Ventre, T. Desmond, S.~Sheppard, S. McSherry;
and a good few exceptional colleagues and friends: we shared a lot about career, life, interests and passions over the years.

Thanks to my original family, and friends, back in Italy,
who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic.

Thanks to my fellow postgraduate students
and thanks to the research staff
at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group
---one special mention for David Rea.
Thanks to my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt, for his patience,
only to mention his least ``technical'' quality;
and his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the journey.
Thanks to all those involved with the teaching labs at UCC;
the  experience as a  first-year demonstrator may not be stricly related,
but we should never forget where even the most sophisticated sector of physics
ultimately comes from.

Last but not least ---as there's no Bob without Alice in any thought natural process---
well, Bob would like to thank Alice;
for every time she’s up when he’s down and vice versa:
their lives may be far away, but they believe in entanglement, and in each other.
