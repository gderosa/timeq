  I have completed this thesis while still working
  full time as an IT professional and
  software engineer in several companies.
  I want to thank key managers like
  I.~Siddiqui, P. Ryan, M. Taylor, N. Raza, P. Kelleher, A. Ventre, T. Desmond, S.~Sheppard, S. McSherry;
  and some exceptional colleagues and friends:
  we shared a lot about career, life, interests and passions over the years.

  Thanks to my family and friends back in Italy,
  who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic.

  Thanks to my fellow postgraduate students
  as well as research staff
  at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group.
  A special mention to David Rea.
  I shall acknowledge my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt's infinite patience,
  only to name his least ``technical'' quality;
  and his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the journey. And many other reasons.

  Last but not least ---as there's no Bob without Alice in any thought ex\-per\-i\-ment---
  well, Bob would like to thank Alice,
  for every time she’s up when he’s down, and vice versa.
  Their lives might be far apart,
  but they believe in the entanglement,
  and in each other.
