  I am certainly missing many people here.
  My apologies in advance.

  I've been working towards this Master's degree
  while continuing a full-time career
  as an IT professional and software engineer.
  I want to thank my
  colleagues and friends, for their encouragement
  and intellectual curiosity
  about my endeavour
  ---only to name a few: Mirek, Lukas, Tamara, Mark, Jalal, Noel.
  I also want to thank those managers
  who have, in various ways, supported or facilitated it:
  I.~Siddiqui, P.~Ryan, M.~Taylor, N.~Raza, P.~Kelleher;
  A.~Ventre;
  T.~Desmond, S.~Sheppard, K.~Chaturvedi, S.~McSherry.

  I want to thank my family, friends, adored ones back in Italy,
  who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic;
  nonetheless they have been always present. I will only mention the youngest ones:
  Nicole, Elena, Marco.

  Thanks to all my fellow postgraduate students,
  as well as research staff,
  at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group in UCC,
  including Cian, Chris, Tom, Anthony\dots
  And a very special mention to David~Rea!
  Above all, I shall acknowledge my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt's immense patience,
  his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the way, and many, many other qualities.
  Also thanks to all those involved in the teaching lab, for the experience as a
  first-year demonstrator that,
  if not strictly connected to the topic of this thesis,
  does remind me where all modern physics ultimately comes from.
