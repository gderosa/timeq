I've been working towards this Master's degree 
while continuing a full-time career as an IT professional and software engineer. 
I want to thank my colleagues and friends 
for their encouragement and intellectual curiosity about this endeavour. 
I also want to thank those managers who have, 
in various ways, 
supported or facilitated it.

I want to thank my family, friends, adored ones back in the continent
---and I can’t wait for us to rejoin after these strange times!
Thanks to all those who have supported this adventure with passion, even idealism, beyond my imagination.

Thanks to  my fellow postgraduate students, as well as research staff, at the
“Shortcuts to Adiabaticity” group in UCC ---and one ``senior collaborator'' in particular! 
Thanks to my supervisor, for his immense patience, his advice against numerous “traps” along the way, 
and many, many other qualities. 
Also thanks to all those involved in the teaching lab, 
for the experience as a first-year demonstrator that, 
if not strictly connected to the topic of this thesis, 
does remind me where all modern physics ultimately comes from.

I am grateful to Nicole, Paul, Irfan, Antonello, Andreas, Mirek, Paola, Marco,
Jalal, Clarissa, Mark, David, Sergio, Rocco, Fedele, Rosario, Trevor, Noel, Chris, Tiziano, Ofelia,
Sandra, Anthony, Tom, Stephen, Beatriz, Lukas, Tadhg, Antonio, Elena, Cian, Nasir, Tamara, 
Deborah, KC, Nico, Margherita. 
In random order, removing duplicates, and certainly missing many ---to whom I apologize.
