  This work has been completed while continuing a parallel career
  as an IT professional and software engineer.
  Thanks to my
  colleagues and friends for their encouragement
  ---and their curiosity,
  as engineers,
  about the exhotic things physicists do.
  I also want to thank those managers
  who have, in various ways, facilitated this:
  I. Siddiqui, P. Ryan, M. Taylor, N. Raza, P. Kelleher;
  A. Ventre;
  T. Desmond, S. Sheppard, S. McSherry.
  
  Thanks to my family and friends back in Italy,
  who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic.

  Thanks to my fellow postgraduate students,
  as well as research staff,
  at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group.
  A special mention to David Rea.
  Above all, I shall acknowledge my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt's unlimited patience,
  his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the journey, and many, many other qualities.
  Also thanks to all those involved in the teaching lab, for the experience as a
  first-year demonstrator that reminds me, ultimately, where all physics comes from.

  Last but not least ---as there's no ``Bob'' without ``Alice''---
  I'd like to thank, well, Alice;
  for every time she’s up when I'm down, and vice versa.
  Our lives may be far apart, but
  wonderfully entangled.
