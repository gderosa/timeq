Work towards this thesis has been undertaken while a parallel career
as IT and software engineer has continued,
substantially uninterrupted;
I want to start thanking people at those companies, for their support and open mind:
this includes managers like I. Siddiqui, P. Ryan, M. Taylor, N. Raza, P. Kelleher, A. Ventre, T. Desmond, S. Sheppard, S. McSherry;
and a good few exceptional colleagues and friends: we shared a lot, about career, life, interests, and passions, over the years.

Thanks to my original family back in Italy,
who I am not seeing ---in person--- for a while during this pandemic.

Thanks to my fellow postgraduate students,
and thanks to the research staff,
at the ``Shortcuts to Adiabaticity'' group
---one special mention for David Rea.

Thanks to my supervisor Andreas Ruschhaupt, for his patience,
only to mention his least ``technical'' quality;
and his advice against numerous ``traps'' along the journey.
%
Thanks to all those involved with the teaching labs at UCC;
the  experience as a demonstrator for first year students may not be stricly related to the thesis,
but we should never forget where even the most sophisticated sector of physics
ultimately comes from.

Last but not least ---as there's no Bob without Alice in any thought or real ex\-per\-i\-ment---
well, Bob would like to thank Alice;
for every time she’s up when he’s down and vice versa:
their lives may be far away, but they believe in entanglement. And in each other.
