I have been working towards a Master's degree in Physics
while continuing a full-time career as a software engineer and IT professional.
I want to thank my colleagues, friends, mentors, managers, in that industry,
for their encouragement and intellectual curiosity about my endeavor.

I want to thank my family, friends, adored ones, back in Italy and beyond.
Thanks to all those who have supported this journey, beyond my imagination.

Thanks to my fellow postgraduate students, with whom I have shared
an office, and long, fruitful conversations;
as well as research Staff, and our Senior Collaborator in a special way.

Thanks to my Supervisor, for his extended patience, among other qualities!
Thanks to the Examiners.

Also thanks to all those involved in the teaching lab,
for the experience as a first-year demonstrator that,
if not strictly connected to the topic of this thesis,
does remind me where all modern physics ultimately comes from.

I am grateful to Nicole, Paul, Irfan, Antonello, Andreas, Mirek, Paolo, Marco,
Jalal, Clarissa, Mark, David, Sergio, Rocco, Bryan, Fedele, Rosario, Trevor, Mossie, Noel, Chris, Tiziano, Ofelia,
Sandra, Anthony, Tom, Gonzalo, Paola, Stephen, Lukas, Antonio, Elena, Cian, Beatriz, Jing, John, Nasir, Tamara,
Deborah, KC, Nico, Margherita. The list is in no particular order and some names may refer to more than one person.
Apologies to all those I may have forgotten.
