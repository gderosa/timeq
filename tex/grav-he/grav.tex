\section{(dis)entanglement under gravity, decoherence, event formalism}

1703.08036 An experiment to test decoherence under gravity aka entangled photons undergoing different paths and how their entanglement is affected.

Are they getting entangled with the environment instead? (Merletto and Vedral).

The theoretical paper behind the space experiment: \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.3677.pdf}. Interestingly, it mentions 
\emph{event formalism}, and we thought about that: is an event something
representable as a proper vector in $\mathcal{L}^2(\mathbb{R}^4)$ --- where one of the dimensions is time?
TODO: deepen the event formalism if it's quantum.

Closed timelike curves are also the subject of a paper by Lloyd (cite!).

``Deutsch argued that
the usual paradoxes associated with such solutions of general
relativity can be resolved by quantum mechanics''
