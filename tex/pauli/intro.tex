\section{Introduction}

In a footnote in~\parencite{PauliFootnote}, W. Pauli excluded the possibility
of a self-adjoint operator representing time as a quantum observable.
However, he did not provide an explicit proof.
Here a proof is given, based on~\parencite{Galapon2002}, but expanded in more detail.
