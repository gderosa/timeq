This work relates to the problem of time in quantum physics%
\footnote{
  See, for a review, \cite{TQM1, TQM2}.
},
from Wolfgang Pauli's argument
on the impossibility of a time observable \parencite{PauliFootnote},
to \emph{relational} models developed in the last decades,
based
on the entanglement of the ordinary Hilbert space of quantum mechanics
with an extra space where a time operator is introduced.

Pauli's objection is analyzed in possibly more details, as well as the models
aimed at overcoming it, in an effort of generalization on one side;
and at bridging a gap between the theoretical
and experimental literature on the other
---adding examples and applications to existing theoretical results,
and a degree of conceptual critique and theoretical analysis
to recent experiments.
