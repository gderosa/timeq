This work relates to the problem of time in quantum physics%
\footnote{
  See, for a review, \cite{TQM1, TQM2}.
},
from Wolfgang Pauli's argument
on the impossibility of defining a quantum observable for time \parencite{PauliFootnote};
to \emph{relational} models developed in the last decades,
where
time, and unitary dynamics, only emerge in
terms of \emph{entanglement} between noninteracting subsystems
---one of which acts as a ``clock''---
of an otherwise stationary universe. \parencite{PageWootters, Marletto:Evolution}

Pauli's objection is analyzed in possibly more detail, as well as some of the models
that have been proposed
to overcome it. 

One of the aims of the present work
is contributing to bridging a gap between the theoretical
and experimental literature on the topic.
To this end, examples and applications are developed on top of existing theoretical results;
and, conversely,
a conceptual critique and theoretical analysis
of recent experiments is also carried out.
