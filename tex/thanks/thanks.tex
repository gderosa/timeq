I wish to thank Andreas, for his huge patience, David for
his ``coaching'',
and all members, past and present, of our Group.

Thanks to several people, in the third and second floor of the Kane building,
who have helped my research; and thanks to those in the first floor,
for the teaching side of my experience in this Department.
Thanks to the ground floor too, for the necessary coffee.
Outside Cork, thanks to Jiri Vala
for organizing the inspiring All-Ireland Conference on Quantum Technologies.
Back in Italy, where I earned my first degree, thanks to Fedele Lizzi and Ofelia Pisanti.

I have no funding agency to thank for this self-funded MSc.,
but I do thank my employers, and managers and colleagues therein,
for the flexible work arrangements and support that have made this possible.

Thanks to my family, also for their concerns about the impact of my choices on an otherwise safer and simpler career,
and for how they eventually pushed me for being consistent with, and honoring, those choices.

Finally, on a rather personal note, there is no Bob without Alice in quantum mechanics.
Ironically, he has insisted in communicating classically with her,
inevitably failing in most cases.
Whether she's standing next to him right now,
or a thousands miles apart performing yet another ``correlation'' experiment,
among the people of his life
she has believed, and believes, more than anyone else in this venture.
