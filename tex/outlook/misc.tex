--- \emph{comment}: time measured and stored here
may be all classical information
so this paper may or may not be relevant for the topic.

But
``prototypes of clocks based on quantum principles,
such as entanglement and squeezing''
may make this interesting again, see reference therein.
They also cite Lloyd, Giovannetti and Maccone,
but a paper quite older than \cite{Lloyd:Time}.

In his works, Zurek mentions:
DeWitt, Everett, gell_Mann, hartl, Many Worlds, consistent/decoherent histories:
idea: Lagrangian over a history? Principle of least action?

Zurek: ``Reduction of the Wavepacket: How Long Does it Take?'' (arxiv),
``quantum''' time? \cite{Zurek_Einselect} also mentions
``decoherence timescale''.
