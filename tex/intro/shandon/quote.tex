  Each side of the [Shandon] tower also contains a clock face. Installed in 1847 and affectionately known as the
  `four-faced liar', the hands on the east and west run slightly fast, especially in windy weather.
  This is probably because they are so very large
  (only Bug Ben in London has larger clock faces).
