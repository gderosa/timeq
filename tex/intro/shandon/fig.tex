    Classical Time. The \emph{Four Faced Liar}, Shandon Bells, Cork
  ]{
    A celebrated example of classical time measurement (and measurement errors) in Cork~City.
    % The \emph{Four Faced Liar}
    % (Shandon Bells, St. Anne's Church, Cork).
    % These four clocks
    % may famously
    % indicate slightly different times from each other.
    ``Each side of the [Shandon Bells] tower also contains a clock face.
    Installed in 1847 and affectionately known as the
    `four-faced liar', the hands on the east and west run slightly fast, especially in windy weather.
    This is probably because they are so very large
    (only Big Ben in London has larger clock faces).''
