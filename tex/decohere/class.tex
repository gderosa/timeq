\section{Quantum and the Environment: from Quantum to Classical}

In sec. \ref{sec:mix} we have considered a simple orthonormal basis
and built a statistical mixture of their vectors. We have shown
that the same density operator can be generated by other ensembles,
not necessarily orthogonal. Nontheless, the orthonormal ensemble,
corresponding to a diagonal representation of $\rho$, \emph{is}
special, only in the sense that an orthonormal, complete set of
vectors can be seen as the eigenbasis for some observable,
and such representation is particularly expressive if the
interaction with the environment we are considering is a 
\emph{measurement}.

In what follows we shall show that a measurement turns
the (sub-)system $S$ from a coherent superposition into a
maximally mixed state like in the examples
\eqref{eq:matrix:pure} and \eqref{eq:matrix:mix}.
Hence, the Born rule, a fundamental concept in the
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, can be
\emph{derived} instead of postulated. Historically,
the effort in overcoming the \term{wavefunction collapse},
regarding the measurement apparatus as a quantum,
and not a classical system,
was pioneered by J. von Neumann \parencite{VonNeumann}.

As a self-adjoint operator, $\rho_S$ after the interaction
can always be diagonalized, so we can conclude that any
interaction with the environment is the measurement of some
observable $A$, at least in the mathematical sense: $A$ may or
may not be of any notable physical significance.

\section{TODO}

Measurement destroys off-diagonal terms and turns a pure state into a mixed one.

Off-diagonal terms in the density matrix indicates ``quantum purity''.
(Or internal Entanglement as well, if the system being detected was bipartite itself?)

In some sense, measurement turned a q-statistical distribution of values for the observable,
into a classical probability distribution.
