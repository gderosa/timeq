\section{Standard measurement and generalizations}

The evolution of the density operator for a closed system is given by the map
\[
    \rho_{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}(\rho_{S}) = U(t)\rho_{S}U^{\dagger}(t) \, \text{.}
\] 
We are looking to describe a more general change
$\rho \rightarrow \mathcal{E}(\rho_{S})$ that may also include
changes due to measurement (or noise).

Furthermore, we are looking to describe a generalization
of projective measurement~\parencite{VonNeumann}:
when a projective, Von-Neumann
measurement is performed on a multipartite system,
it does not necessarily correspond to a projective measurement
on each subsystem~\parencite[Ch. 3]{PreskillNotes}.
