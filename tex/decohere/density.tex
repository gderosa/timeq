\section{Density operator}\label{app:density}

A quantum state (either pure or \term{mixed}),
is generally described by a \term{density} (or \term{state}) operator $\rho$.
It's a well known result (see, for example, \cite{open_systems})
that the expectation value of an observable represented by the operator $A$
is given in this description by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:expvalA_rho}
  \expval{A} = \tr(A\rho)\,.
\end{equation}

The \eqref{eq:expvalA_rho} is valid for any hermitean operator $A$,
hence we can replace it with the projector $P_{\sigma}$,
associated to the set of eigenvalues $\sigma$
according to \eqref{eq:pi_sigma} and \eqref{eq:P_sigma_spectral},
which is of particular interest
because its mean value equates the probability that the outcome of a measurement
falls in a given subset of the spectrum of a given observable.
Hence we can derive:

\begin{proposition}\label{probability_rho}
  The probability $\pi_{\sigma}$
  that the outcome of a measurement of the observable $A$
  on the system described by the state operator $\rho$
  falls in the set $\sigma$
  is given by:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:probability_rho}
    \pi_{\sigma} = \expval{P_{\sigma}} = \tr(P_{\sigma}\rho)
  \end{equation}
  with $P_{\sigma}$ defined as in \eqref{eq:pi_sigma}
  or, more generally, in \eqref{eq:P_sigma_spectral}.
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Properties of the density operator}
\subsubsection{Additivity}
The general expression for a density operator $\rho$ is
$$
  \rho = \sum_{k}p_{k}\ketbra{\psi_{k}}
$$
with $p_{k}$ non negative and $\sum_{k}p_{k} = 1$.

The condition is not restrictive to prevent proving the following
\begin{proposition}
  Let $A$ be an hermitean operator such that
  $$
    \tr(A\rho) = 0 
  $$
  \emph{for any density operator} $\rho$.

  It follows that $A = 0$.

  \begin{proof}
    We can choose,
    as basis to explicit the expresion of the trace,
    a complete set of eigenvectors $\{\ket{m}\}$ of $A$ and,
    for each positive integer $n$,
    a particular density operator $\rho = \ketbra{n}$,
    corresponding to a (pure) eigenstate of $A$.

    With this particular choice,
    for each $n$,
    $$
      A\rho = \mel{n}{A}{n}\ketbra{n}\,.
    $$
    It then follows:
    $$
      0 = \tr(A\rho) = \sum_{m}\mel{m}{ ( \mel{n}{A}{n}\ketbra{n} ) }{m}
        = \sum_{m} \mel{n}{A}{n} \braket{m}{n} \braket{n}{m}
        = \mel{n}{A}{n}\,,
    $$
    hence the generic diagonal element of the (diagonal) matrix of $A$ is null,
    and so is consequently the operator $A$ itself.
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
If $\tr(A\rho) + \tr(B\rho) = \tr(C\rho)$ for any density operator $\rho$,
then $A + B = C$.
\end{corollary}
