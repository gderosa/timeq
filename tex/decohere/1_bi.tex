\section{Bipartite systems, separable and entangled states}

Consider a \term{bipartite quantum system}
i.e. a composite system $S$
made up of two parts, $A$ and~$B$,
described by their respective Hilbert spaces
$\hilb{H}_A$ and $\hilb{H}_B$.

Notably, in \cite{Haroche_Exploring},
notation does not treat the two spaces
on perfectly equal footing,
in the sense that a basis for $\hilb{H}_A$ and a basis for $\hilb{H}_B$
are indicated as
$$
  \setof{\ket{i_A}} \text{ and } \setof{\ket{\mu_B}}\,
$$
with latin and greek indices to label base vectors in the two spaces.
We will follow such convention unless otherwise specified.

This indicates different physical roles for the two spaces,
such as the \emph{system of interest} and the surrounding \emph{environment},
or the \emph{system being measured} and the \emph{measurement apparatus}.

If the two subsystems are independent, all states of $S$ are of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:separableAB}
  \ket{\psi_S} = \ket{\psi_A}\otimes\ket{\psi_A}
\end{equation}
i.e. they form a strict \emph{subspace} of $\hilb{H}_A\otimes\hilb{H}_B$.

It's worth recalling that in a tensor product space $\hilb{H}_A\otimes\hilb{H}_B$
not all vectors can be expressed as a tensor product as in \eqref{eq:separableAB}.
When a vector in a tensor product space
can be expressed in the form \eqref{eq:separableAB},
it's said \term{separable} \parencite{Nakahara}.

\begin{proposition}\label{TensorBase}
The set of tensor products of base vectors of $\hilb{H}_A$ and $\hilb{H}_B$,
i.e. $$\setof{\ket{i_A} \otimes \ket{\mu_B}}_{i\mu},$$
is a basis for $\hilb{H}_A \otimes \hilb{H}_B$
\end{proposition}

In general, given the above property yet the fact that not all states
in a tensor product space are separable, we can still express any
(generally not separable) state vector of $\hilb{H}_S$
as a \emph{superposition} of separable base vectors
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bipartite_expansion}
  \ket{\psi_S} = \sum_{i, \mu}\alpha_{i\mu}\ket{i_A}\otimes\ket{\mu_B} \neq \ket{\psi_A}\otimes\ket{\psi_B},
\end{equation}
meaning that the
``total'' $\ket{\psi_A}$ and $\ket{\psi_B}$ don't necessarily exist.

Non separable states are said \term{entangled}.
Physically,
$\ket{\psi_S}$ contains information
not only about the results of measurements on $A$ and $B$ separately,
but also on correlations between these measurements
\parencite{Haroche_Exploring}.

The simplest example of entangled system is given by two two-level systems,
namely two spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in a singlet state:
\[
  \ket{\psi_{\text{singlet}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(\ket{\uparrow, \downarrow} - \ket{\downarrow, \uparrow}\right).
\]
