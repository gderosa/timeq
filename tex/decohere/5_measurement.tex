\section[Channels, operations and generalized measurement]
  {Quantum channels, quantum operations and generalized measurement}

Decoherence,
or more generally the interaction of a system with the environment,
can be seen as a process of information loss for the system
\parencite[Ch. 9]{Nakahara} or information storage
\parencite{Zurek_Einselect}, if the system under consideration
is \emph{the observer}.

A \term{quantum operation} \parencite[Ch. 9]{Nakahara} is the generalization
of unitary evolution to include open systems as well as closed ones.

The evolution of the density operator for a closed system is given by the map
\[
    \rho_{S} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}(\rho_{S}) = U(t)\rho_{S}U^{\dagger}(t) \, \text{.}
\] 
We are looking to describe a general more change
$\rho \rightarrow \mathcal{E}(\rho_{S})$ that may also include
changes due to measurement (or noise).

Furthermore, we are looking to describe a generalization
of projective measurement~\parencite{VonNeumann}:
as when a projective, Von-Neumann
measurement is performed on a multipartite system,
it does not necessarily correspond to a projective measurement
on each subsystem~\parencite[Ch. 3]{PreskillNotes}.
