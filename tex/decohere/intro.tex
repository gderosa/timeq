This chapter is devoted to briefly recall some
foundations and modern developments of quantum measurement theory.
It's strongly based on works like
\cite{PreskillNotes, Haroche_Exploring, Nakahara, NielsenChuang, open_systems},
where they are presented in the context of
open quantum systems and quantum information theory.
