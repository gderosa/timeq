\section{The rest aka TODO}

Measurement destroys off-diagonal terms and turns a pure state into a mixed one.

Off-diagonal terms in the density matrix indicates ``quantum purity''.
(Or internal Entanglement as well, if the system being detected was bipartite itself?)

In some sense, measurement turned a q-statistical distribution of values for the observable,
into a classical probability distribution.
