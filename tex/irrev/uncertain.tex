\section{Uncertainty}

In a continuous-time Page-Wootters universe,
one is tempted to observe that in $\hilb{H}_T$,
in the time representation, it is $E \eqbydef \hbar\hat{\Omega} \repr i\hbar\partial_{t}$,
in analogy with $\hat{p} \repr -i\hbar\partial_{q}$ in $\hilb{H}_S$,
therefore a time-energy uncertainty relation can be derived
with a proof that is formally identical to the well known
position-momentum uncertainty relation. However, it's worth
noting that the time evolution of a system is never expressed
in terms of a separable state (and therefore a pure state in $\hilb{H}_T$)
but always a maximally entangled state in the product space
\begin{equation}
  \int \dd t \, \phi(t) \ket{t}_T \ox \ket{\psi(t)}_S \, \text{,}
\end{equation}
therefore the spatial degrees of freedom should be \emph{traced out},
before deriving a time-energy relation 
---in terms of the reduced density operator and partial traces.

As also stated in \cite{Lloyd:Time},
the above can be formulated with respect to an eigenbasis of $\Omega$ (frequency)
instead of $t$ (time):
\begin{equation}
  \int \dd \omega \, \tilde{\phi}(\omega) \ket{\omega}_T \ox \ket{\tilde{\psi}(\omega)}_S \, \text{,}
\end{equation}


\subsection{TODO ME}

But there's hope: use \eqref{eq:density_A_expand}

\[
  \rho^T = \Tr_S\qty(\dketdbra{\Phi}{\Phi}) = \int \dd t \abs{\phi(t)}^2 \ketbra{t}{t} 
\]

\[
  \rho^T = \Tr_S\qty(\dketdbra{\Phi}{\Phi}) = \int \dd \omega \abs{\tilde{\phi}(\omega)}^2 \ketbra{\omega}{\omega} 
\]

They're clasical prob. ; proerties of Fourier etc.
