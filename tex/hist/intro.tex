\section{Time and the Quantum: An invitation}\label{sec:intro}

Time is a fundamental concept in physics, together with space (or \term{position} within space),
matter (or \emph{mass}) and energy.

In quantum mechanics, at least in first quantization, defining the \emph{position} as
an observable is unproblematic and somewhat basic.
Indeed, representing the quantum state of a particle
in terms of coefficients with respect to eigenstates of position is extremely common.
Almost always when a ``wavefunction'' $\psi$
for a state $\ket{\psi}$
is written down, the \emph{position representation}
is assumed, unless otherwise (explicitly) noted:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:positionrepr}
  \ket{\psi} = \int \dd{x'} \psi(x') \ket{x'} \text{,}
\end{equation}
where\footnote{
  Here a one-dimensional system is considered, for simplicity:
  it can be easily verified that more dimensions,
  and degeneracy, may be taken into account without altering the core rationale of the
  following arguments in this Section.
}
$\psi(x') = \braket{x'}{\psi}$.

As per \emph{mass}, a quantum mechanism that explains how particle acquire mass was theorized by
Peter Higgs and others in 1964, and confirmed experimentally in 2012
\parencite{Higgs, EnglertBrout, Kibble+, HiggsATLAS, HiggsCMS}.

\emph{Energy} is associated with arguably the most important operator in quantum dynamics: the Hamiltonian.

\emph{Time} is missing from this picture. As of writing of the present work,
there is no general consensus in the physics community on
the definition of a quantum operator associated to a time observable,
or even only on a particular quantum mechanism that would allow time to ``emerge'',
for example as an effective quantity.

\subsection{Time, and position}

Rigorously speaking, the position observable has no special role in quantum mechanics.
Eq.~\eqref{eq:positionrepr} can be further expanded to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:qprepr}
  \ket{\psi} = \int \dd{x'} \psi(x') \ket{x'} = \int \dd{p'} \tilde{\psi}(p') \ket{p'} \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
with $p$ and $\ket{p}$ being respectively eigenvalues and eigenvectors of linear \emph{momentum}.
The fact that the symbol $\ket{\psi}$ instead of $\ket{\tilde{\psi}}$
is used for the state vector is a pure matter of convention.\footnote{
  Although, position representation is widely regarded as easier
  to ``visualize'' within our intuition,
  whenever a position observable can be defined
  and there aren't particular computational needs for doing otherwise.
}

By multiplying on the left by $\bra{x}$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:positionrepr} yields
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diracdeltax}
  \psi(x) = \int \dd{x'} \psi(x') \delta(x-x') \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
showing that for an observable with continuous spectrum,
in its own eigenbasis, eigenstates are represented as a Dirac deltas
(for discrete spectrums, the integral is replaced by a discrete sum,
and Dirac deltas by Kronecker deltas).

Applying the position operator $\hat{x}$ to the~\eqref{eq:positionrepr},
then taking the inner product on the left by $\bra{x}$,
there has
\begin{equation}
  \qty[\hat{x}\psi](x) \eqbydef \mel{x}{\hat{x}}{\psi} =
    \int \dd{x'} \psi(x') x' \mel{x}{\hat{x}}{x'} =
    \int \dd{x'} \psi(x') \delta(x-x') =
    x\psi(x)
  \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
which
shows that the position
(and an observable in general) is represented, in its own eigenbasis,
as a simple multiplication of the original wavefunction by the respective variable.

\subsection{Time evolution and relativity}\label{sec:trel}

Eq.~\eqref{eq:diracdeltax} is a mathematical identity
of general validity,
regardless of any particular physical meaning,
and can be easily generalized to functions
of more variables.

On a different note
---as a matter of experience if not anything else---
the state of a physical system, either classical or quantum,
with all observable quantities,
can be regarded as a function of the instant in \emph{time}
(let's call that independent variable $t$).
The same cannot be stated in general for any other pair of measurable quantities:
the $x$ coordinate is not a function of the $y$ coordinate
(or their respective statistical amplitudes, in the quantum realm),
and so on.
This status of time as the universally independent variable
has shaped classical mathematical physics: Galilean transformations
do not change time, which stays as an absolute quantity.
The Hamiltonian formalism itself is based on this assumption,
and the Hamiltonian formalism is at the foundation of quantum mechanics too,
which thus inherits ---one may argue--- the difficulties connected to
treating time as ``external'' with respect to the other quantities under study.
``[The] Hamiltonian method [\dots] marks out a particular time variable
as the canonical conjugate of the Hamiltonian function'' \parencite{DiracLagrangian}.

Emphasizing time as a parameter, the value of a wavefunction
(in position representation, for example)
can therefore be expressed as $\psi_{t}(x)$ at each position $x$
and at each time $t$.
Still, it can be regarded as a function of two variables
and one may wonder why (after an inessential change of notation),
in the identity
\begin{equation}\label{eq:diracdeltaxt}
  \psi(x; t) = \int \dd{x'}\dd{t'} \delta(x-x')\delta(t-t') \psi(x';\, t') \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
the term $\delta(t-t')$ cannot be interpreted as the eigenfunction of some time operator,
which in turn acts as a simple multiplication by $t$ on this
wavefunction $\psi(x; t)$ ---which would be, therefore, a wavefunction in ``time--position representation''.
In other words, why cannot the instant in \emph{time}
and the position in \emph{space}
be treated equally?

The fact that $\delta(t-t')$ would be an \emph{improper} eigenfunction
is not the blocking issue in this case (it is not, for the position eigenfunction),
and the mathematical delicacies related to the continuous spectrum are
elegantly resolved by the spectral theory, mainly by Von Neumann
\parencite{VonNeumann}, which is an integral part of the standard, commonly accepted
formulation of quantum mechanics, almost since the early years of the theory.

The idea of treating space and time on equal footing might naturally lead the reader to
ask another question: whether a theory combining quantum mechanics with Einstein's
theory of relativity is the suitable framework which would allow a rigorous and logically consistent
definition of a time observable.

None of the proposed models comprehending both quantum theory and \emph{general} relativity
have reached general consensus,
or the remote possibility of experimental verification to date \parencite{QGravIntro}.
However, \term{quantum field theory} (QFT) is an established framework that does combine
some principles
of quantum mechanics with the \emph{special} theory of relativity.
Unfortunately, QFT not only does not promote time $t$ to some quantum operator $\hat{t}$,
but it does also ``demote'' \emph{position} to the role of a classical parameter.
It treats time and space equally only in the sense that they are all classical,
which appears as the necessary tradeoff in order to quantize other quantities
in some mathematically tractable way. Even at lower energies,
a position operator, let alone time, requires a first-quantized description,
which is unsuitable for e.g. photons.
Indeed, photon position in quantum optics is as controversial
(and subject of current research ---\cite{HawtonPhotonPosition, Hawton2019})
as time in quantum mechanics.
