\section{POVM}\label{sec:hist:povm}

POVM is
a more general, ``unsharp'' measurement, as opposed to projective measurement;
a concept we have reviewed in Chapter~\ref{ch:decohere}.
Quantum time measurement can be formulated as a POVM
(see ```Standard' Quantum-Mechanical Approach to Times of Arrival'', \cite[Ch. 10]{TQM1}).
This ``standard'' approach does not require an extra Hilbert space \emph{for the clock}.

TODO: possibly, connect with Kijowski and reuse conclusion of \cite[Sec. 4.1.1]{TQM2}?
