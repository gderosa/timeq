\section{Detector models}

As we have seen in the previous sections,
proper elements of $\pwspace$,
localized in both space and time,
can be interpreted as ``events''
(as opposed to full history vectors, which instead describe the unitary evolution
of a quantum system \emph{at all times}).

The arrival of a particle at a detector
is a kind of event
of particular interest from the perspective of time
in quantum mechanics, for several reasons.

The first reason
is the direct connection with experiments,
``given the appalling evidence that time is also a random variable in the laboratories''
\parencite[Sec. 4.1]{TQM2};
and because,
``{[as]} a matter of fact, a number of time observables are already routinely measured in laboratories,
for example arrival times in time-of-flight experiments,
but the theoretical foundation of these measurements is still being discussed''
\parencite[Preface to the First Ed.]{TQM1}.

The second reason is the existence of studies
about detector models which also investigate
time-of-arrival as a quantum observable.
In particular we will consider \cite{RuschhauptAbsorption},
which in turn traces back its basic ideas from the seminal work by Allcock
in the 1960s \parencite{Allcock-1, Allcock-2, Allcock-3},
while a detailed contemporary formulation can be found in
\cite{TQM2:Detector}.
None of these works are explicitly
based on Page--Wootters relational model ---of which, to our knowledge,
there are no working examples of application to
time-of-detection problems in the current literature.
Section \ref{sec:absorption+pw} and the remainder of the chapter
will be devoted to bridging such gap
by implementing such application
and comparing
the results from the different models.
Some emphasis will be given to
\emph{discrete} relational time
using the techniques developed in Chapter \ref{ch:pw}.

\subsection{The papers by Allcock and following developments}

With three papers dated 1969 \parencite{Allcock-1, Allcock-2, Allcock-3}, G. R. Allcock
introduced a time-of-arrival quantum observable,
along with a first formulation of a detector model based on a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian (by including a \term{complex potential}).
See in particular \cite[sec. II-IV]{Allcock-2}, where an anti-Hermitian term
$-iV_0\theta(x)$ is introduced in the Hamiltonian,
to model an absorber aim at detecting
the arrival of a particle in the region $x>0$
(here $\theta$ is the Heaviside \term{step function}).
The particle state evolves
in non-unitary manner, with a transfer of probability
from an ``incident channel''
into ``orthogonal and time-labelled measurement channels''.
Unfortunately Allcock came to negative conclusions regarding this approach.
Among other objections, he noticed that when $V_0$ is large the particle is not absorbed but reflected;
while, when it's small (i.e. the detector has a low absorption rate), the particle is eventually absorbed but
with an indetermination $\delta_T \sim \frac{1}{2}V_{0}^{-1}$
that becomes, in such case, inpractically large.
Also, Allcock did not tackle directlty the Pauli objection (see Sec. \ref{proof})
but rather maintained that argument.



\subsection*{TODO / ``backlog''}

Use the detector chapter Ruschhaupt book for both getting more references above and description following.
Also the history chapter, section on Allcock.

Allcock introduced the absorbing detector model based on a in ``imaginary'''' term $-iV_0$
(anti-Hermitian) (which makes the whole Hamiltonian non-Hermitian) in a series of three papers
\parencite{Allcock-1, Allcock-2, Allcock-3},
particularly in \cite[sec. II-IV]{Allcock-2}.

He noticed that when $V_0$ is large the particle is not absorbed but reflected.

When it's small, the particle is absorbed, but ``in a very large length'' (duration?)

Muga and others responded to this concern by finding ``better potentials'' that absorb essentially the
whole wave packet in a short space interval (and time?)
\parencite{Muga_TOAQM, Muga_CompositeAbsPot, ComplexAbsPot} (\emph{verify}).

For plane waves, this interval can be made arbitrarily small.

\begin{quotation}
  For wave packets the length can be small but not zero because of a
  peculiar property of quantum perfect absorbers; they exactly reproduce
  the behavior of the wave function defined in the absence of the absorber.
  Therefore, they must accumulate and give back norm to reproduce the
  ``backflow effect'' \parencite{Bracken_bf, Bracken_ProbTransport}
  (\emph{where authors just talk about backflow per se})
  by which wave functions without negative momentum components
  have negative current density at certain time and position intervals
  \parencite{Leavens_backflow}. (\emph{where they actually talk about perfect absorbers})
