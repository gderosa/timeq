\section{Detector models}

As we have seen in the previous sections,
proper elements of $\pwspace$,
localized in both space and time,
can be interpreted as ``events''
(as opposed to full history vectors, which instead describe the unitary evolution
of a quantum system \emph{at all times}).

The arrival of a particle at a detector
is a kind of event
of particular interest from the perspective of time
in quantum mechanics, for several reasons.

The first reason
is the direct connection with experiments,
``given the appalling evidence that time is also a random variable in the laboratories''
\parencite[Sec. 4.1]{TQM2};
and because,
``{[as]} a matter of fact, a number of time observables are already routinely measured in laboratories,
for example arrival times in time-of-flight experiments,
but the theoretical foundation of these measurements is still being discussed''
\parencite[Preface to the First Ed.]{TQM1}.

The second reason is the existence of studies
about detector models which also investigate
the time-of-arrival as a quantum observable
(\cite{RuschhauptAbsorption} \colorbox{purple}{\color{white}\textbf and many others});
although they are not ---at least explicitly---
based on the Page--Wootters relational model,
of which, to our knowledge,
there are no working examples of application to
problems of particle detection in the current literature.

In this section, we attempt at bridging this gap
by implementing such application through a few examples
and comparing
the results from the different models.
Some emphasis will be given
to \emph{discrete} relational time using the techniques
developed in Chapter \ref{ch:pw}.

\subsection*{TODO / ``backlog''}

Use the detector chapter Ruschhaupt book for both getting more references above and description following.

Allcock introduced the absorbing detector model based on a in ``imaginary'''' term $-iV_0$
(anti-Hermitian) (which makes the whole Hamiltonian non-Hermitian) in a series of three papers
\parencite{Allcock-1, Allcock-2, Allcock-3},
particularly in \cite[sec. II-IV]{Allcock-2}.

He noticed that when $V_0$ is large the particle is not absorbed but reflected.

When it's small, the particle is absorbed, but ``in a very large length'' (duration?)

Muga and others responded to this concern by finding ``better potentials'' that absorb essentially the
whole wave packet in a short space interval (and time?)
\parencite{Muga_TOAQM, Muga_CompositeAbsPot, ComplexAbsPot} (\emph{verify}).

For plane waves, this interval can be made arbitrarily small.

\begin{quotation}
  For wave packets the length can be small but not zero because of a
  peculiar property of quantum perfect absorbers; they exactly reproduce
  the behaviour of the wave function defined in the absence of the absorber.
  Therefore, they must accumulate and give back norm to reproduce the
  ``backflow effect'' \parencite{Bracken_bf, Bracken_ProbTransport}
  (\emph{where authors just talk about backflow per se})
  by which wave functions without negative momentum components
  have negative current density at certain time and position intervals
  \parencite{Leavens_backflow}. (\emph{where thay actually talk about perfect absobers})
