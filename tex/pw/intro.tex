\section{Introduction}

To introduce the Page--Wootters model, let us first consider
a bipartite system $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$,
the two subsystems of which have finite dimension\footnote{
  In general, within the model,
  the system may as well be infinite-dimensional;
  the sum may be replaced by an integral (continuous spectrum);
  and the vector in the tensor-product space may be not normalizable (an improper vector).
  Nonetheless, a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is sufficient to construct several applications of interest.
}$N$,
and are completely
entangled, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:finite-entanglement}
  \hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B \ni \dket{\Psi}
  =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ket{\tau_{n}}_{A} \ox \ket{\psi_{n}}_{B} \text{.}
\end{equation}
Here
a ``double angle bracket'' notation $\dket{\Psi}$ has been adopted
for vectors in the tensor product space $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$.
We assume $\ket{\psi_{n}}_{B}$ are all \emph{normalized} in $\hilb{H}_B$;
and
$\qty{\ket{{\tau}_n}}$ is an orthonormal eigenbasis of some observable (say, $T$) in system A.
Let also $\dket{\Psi}$ be \emph{stationary}, meaning it is an eigenstate
of the overall Hamiltonian $\mathbb{J}$ in $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$:
$$
  \mathbb{J} \dket{\Psi} = \epsilon \dket{\Psi} \text{.}
$$
Finally, we assume that the two subsystems $A$ and $B$ are \emph{non interacting},
meaning that the global Hamiltonian $\mathbb{J}$ can be expressed as a sum of two terms
which only act on the respective subspaces $\hilb{H}_A$ and $\hilb{H}_B$
(and there is no explicit ``interaction term''). In other words,
$\mathbb{J}$ can be expressed as
$$
  \mathbb{J} = H_A \ox \idop_B + \idop_A \ox H_B \, \text{.} 
$$
Therefore, with the ordinary notion of ``time as a parameter'',
the evolution of system B will only depend on ``its own'' Hamiltonian $H_B$, namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:ordinary_B}
  \ket{\psi(t)}_B = e^{- i \hbar t / H_B } \ket{\psi(0)}_B \text{.}  
\end{equation}
 
In the Page--Wootters model, time evolution is based on an internal entanglement
relation among subsystems of an isolated system
---including the case where such isolated system is the whole universe.

The overall system
---as the one described by $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$ in \eqref{eq:pw:finite-entanglement}---
is stationary and there is no notion
of time external to it.
This is also known as the
``timeless'' approach \parencite{Marletto:Evolution}.
\citereset
A suitable subsystem is chosen within the ``universe'' so that it acts as
\emph{clock} for the \emph{rest} of it, in the sense that
there is an observable $T$ (in the above example, in system $A$)
that can be used to
describe time evolution ``without evolution''\footnote{
  The expression ``evolution without evolution''
  is directly quoted from the title of \cite{PageWootters},
  and recalled in \cite{Marletto:Evolution}.
}
of system $B$
and is canonically conjugate to the Hamiltonian $H_A$.

% Please note, while the time evolution of system $B$,
% the time operator $T$ is defined in system $A$ ---and canonically conjugate to $H_A$, not $H_B$.
% In other words, the time operator is defined in a different Hilbert space, therefore
% the Pauli objection no longer applies. A suitable entanglement relation ensures that 
% the ``time'' measured by a clock in one system is relevant to the evolution of the other system.

Quantitatively,
the observable $T$ in $\hilb{H}_A$
has eigenvalues $\tau_n$ which can be interpreted as possible
instants of time in the evolution of $\ket{\psi}_B$, in the sense that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:discrete_approx}
  \Big[ \ket{\psi(t)}_B \Big]_{t=\tau_n} \simeq \,\,\,\, \ket{\psi_n}_B \, \text{,}
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\psi(t)}_B$ is the same of~\eqref{eq:pw:ordinary_B} i.e.
the evolution one would obtain in ``ordinary'' way
by resolving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in system B.
Please note, in eq.~\eqref{eq:pw:discrete_approx} we do not use strict equality:
in its original formulation the Page--Wootters model is still based on a continuous
notion of time, and the same applies to more recent developments \parencite{Lloyd:Time}:
whether a discrete formulation
brings a good approximation
will be verified numerically.

An intuitive description may be as follows.
From the perspective of system B, time is a parameter $t$, however it can have values
$\tau_n$ (or \emph{all} real values, in a continuous model)
which are also eigenvalues of an observable $T$ defined in \emph{another system} A,
with which it is entangled. Such entanglement relation establishes a correspondence
between ``instants of time'' (eigenvalues and eigenstates of $T$ in system A)
and (``evolved'') states in system B. Thus, time can be regarded as a quantum observable,
although defined in a different Hilbert space than the one of the Hamiltonian of interest.
As $H_B$ and $T$ acts on two different Hilbert spaces, the Pauli objection is no longer valid
(how canonical conjugation and uncertainty relations hold will be clearer in Sec.~\ref{sec:pw:uncertainty}).

A slightly different notation than $\hilb{H}_A$ and $\hilb{H}_B$ (and their tensor product)
might be useful at this stage, given
the physical interpretation of the two spaces is now established.
Some authors
use $\hilb{H}_C$ and $\hilb{H}_R$
to indicate the Hilbert spaces of the clock (C) and the rest (R) of the ``universe''
(or isolated system):
see, for example, \cite{Marletto:Evolution}.
Others ---as in \cite{Lloyd:Time}--- 
choose $\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$ to indicate the Hilbert space where
a time operator $T$ is defined and, respectively,
the ordinary Hilbert space of the System.
It is also tempting to relate $\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$
to temporal (T) and spatial (S)
degrees of freedom, thus forming a sort of
``space-time'' (and this will be even more apparent
with a relativistic extension that will be sketched in Sec.~\ref{sec:KG}).
More details on symbols and conventions follow.

\subsection*{Notation}

In this and following chapters, when treating quantum time models,
$\hilb{H}_S$ will indicate the Hilbert space of ordinary quantum mechanics.
$\hilb{H}_T$, an extra space where a time operator ${T}$ is introduced. The tensor
product space $\pwspace$
will often be referred to as well.
Bras and kets in this tensor product space will be indicated with a special double-angle-bracket
notation, as in $\dket{\Psi}$.

${\mathbb{J}}$ (blackboard bold) indicates an  operator defined in
a larger space than the one of standard quantum mechanics,
typically the product $\pwspace$.

The symbol `$\repr$', as in $\op{A} \repr \mqty(a&b\\c&d)$, $\ket{\psi} \repr \mqty[\alpha \\ \beta]$
means: representation with respect to a particular basis (as opposed to intrinsic equality `$=$').

The symbol `$\eqbydef$'
means: equal by definition, equal by settings i.e. postulated and not derived logically.
