\section{Introduction}

The Page and Wootters model is based on
an additional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_T$,
where time is an observable
represented by a self-adjoint operator
whose properties are similar to the ones of position
in ordinary quantum mechanics
\parencite{Lloyd:Time, Maccone:Pauli}.

In this language, the ordinary Hilbert space can be labeled $\mathcal{H}_S$;
and we consider the product space $\mathcal{H}_T \otimes \mathcal{H}_S$ as
the space in which both time and position are observables, and they act as
$\hat{t} \otimes \idop_S$ and $\idop_T \otimes \hat{x}$
respectively.

\begin{remark}
  In a more ``relativistic friendly'' notation, we may set
  $\hat{x_0} = c\hat{t}$ and consider
  $\hat{x_0} \otimes \idop_S$ and $\idop_T \otimes \hat{x_1}$,
  and so on. An interesting development may be expressing
  Lorentz transformations as unitary transformations in
  $\mathcal{H}_T \otimes \mathcal{H}_S$.
\end{remark}

The Page and Wootters mechanism is rooted in the ``problem of time''
in quantum cosmology.
In principle, an approriate system (a ``clock'') can be identified in such a way
to be described in $\mathcal{H}_T$, while $\mathcal{H}_S$ describes
the quantum states of \emph{the rest of the universe} \parencite{Marletto:Evolution}.

As explained in \cite{Lloyd:Time, Maccone:Pauli}, the overall Hamiltonian,
encompassing both position and time as observables, is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pwHamiltonian}
  \hat{\mathbb{J}} = \hbar\hat{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_T\ox\hat{H}_S \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
while the \term{Wheeler-DeWitt equation} holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt}
  \hat{\mathbb{J}}\dket{\Psi} = 0 \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
describing a \emph{static} universe, where evolution is only
in terms of relations between parts of a multipartite system
(a ``clock'' and ``the rest'').

Using the $T$ representation in $\hilb{H}_T$,
and comparing \eqref{eq:pwHamiltonian} and \eqref{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt}:
\begin{equation}
  0 = \qty(\hbar\hat{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_{T}\ox\hat{H}_S)\dket{\Psi}
    = -i\hbar\pdv{t}\ket{\psi(t)}_{S} + \hat{H}_S\ket{\psi(t)}_{S}
    \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
we recover the usual form of the Schr\"{o}dinger eqaution in $H_S$.
Details of this derivation are in the reference aforementioned.

Here $\hat{\Omega}$ can be seen as a ``frequency operator''
represented as $-i\pdv{t}$ and having as eigenfunctions
those functions evolving in time with a phase factor $e^{i \omega t}$ only.

Canonical commutation relation holds and can be easily verified
between $\hat{t}$ and $\hat{\Omega}$
i.e. $[\hat{t}, \hat{\Omega}] = i$,
therefore $\hbar\hat{\Omega}$ can be seen as the ``linear momentum''
in the Hilbert space of time.

From another point of view, $\hbar\hat{\Omega}$ is the ``hamiltonian'' of $\hilb{H}_T$,
in that it plays a similar role of $H_S$ in the construction of
$\hat{\mathbb{J}}$ in \eqref{eq:pwHamiltonian}. This dual role doesn't hold
for $H_S$. 

This ambiguity is related to the asymmetry of space and time in non-relativistic
mechanics and can be expressively synthetised in the below:

It would be interesting to a study relativistic extension of the
Page and Wootters model that allows, for example, the derivation of the Klein-Gordon
equation, thus eliminating the asimmetry between
$\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$ (and momentum and energy as well).

In the bipartite universe, physical kets $\dket{\Psi}$ have a Schmidt decomposition
made up of
eigenstates of $\hat{\Omega}$ in $\hilb{H}_T$
entangled, respectively, with
eigenstates of $\hat{H}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$;
or eigenstates of $\hat{t}$ in $\hilb{H}_T$
entangled with time-evolved spatial states $\ket{\psi(t)}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$
(according to the evolution that is embedded in $\hat{\mathbb{J}}$):
\begin{equation}
  \dket{\Psi} = \int d\mu(\omega) \ket{\omega}_{T}\ox\ket{\psi(\omega)}_{S} = \int dt \ket{t}_{T} \ox \ket{\psi(t)}_{S}\,\text{.} 
\end{equation}
In principle, different and less obvious decompositions are possible for other purposes.
