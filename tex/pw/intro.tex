\subsection*{\it Structure of the Chapter}

Sections \ref{sec:pw:theory_first}--\ref{sec:pw:theory_last}
will be devoted to outlining the Page and Wootters theory, reviewing existing papers,
with some original considerations ---particularly with regards to
time--energy (or time--frequency) uncertainty relations, and
finite-dimensional systems (discrete clocks).

Sections \ref{sec:pw:apps_first}--\ref{sec:pw:apps_last} will be dedicated to
applications of the Page--Wootters model, starting with a review and discussion of existing
experiments (or ``experimental illustrations''),
then implementing numerical simulations, with a larger number of clock levels.
Finally, the Page and Wootters model will be compared to the results of
detection and time-of-arrival models
based on non-unitary evolution.

\section{The Model}\label{sec:pw:theory_first}

To introduce the Page--Wootters model, let us first consider
a bipartite system $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$.
%% Move to finite-dim section? is this just a redundant repetition?
% the two subsystems of which have finite dimension\footnote{
%   In general, within the model,
%   the system may as well be infinite-dimensional;
%   the sum may be replaced by an integral (continuous spectrum);
%   and the vector in the tensor-product space may be not normalizable (an improper vector).
%   Nonetheless, a finite-dimensional Hilbert space is sufficient to construct several applications of interest.
% } $N$ each.
% Let us also consider the following entangled state:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:finite-entanglement}
%   \hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S \ni \dket{\Psi}
%   =
%   \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ket{\tau_{n}}_{T} \ox \ket{\psi_{n}}_{S} \text{.}
% \end{equation}
Here
a ``double angle bracket'' notation $\dket{\Psi}$ has been adopted
for vectors in the tensor product space $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$.
We assume that $\ket{\psi_{n}}_{S}$ are all \emph{normalized} in $\hilb{H}_S$;
and
$\qty{\ket{{\tau}_n}}$ is an orthonormal eigenbasis of some observable (say, $\op{T}$)
in $\hilb{H}_T$.
Furthermore, let $\dket{\Psi}$ be \emph{stationary}, meaning it is an eigenstate
of an overall Hamiltonian $\op{\mathbb{J}}$ in $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt}  %%  eq:Wheeler-DeWitt + eq:pwHamiltonian
  \op{\mathbb{J}} \dket{\Psi} = 0 \text{.}
\end{equation}
Finally, we assume that the two subsystems
are \emph{non interacting},
meaning that the global Hamiltonian $\mathbb{J}$ can be expressed as a sum of two terms
which only act on the respective subspaces $\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$
(and there is no explicit ``interaction term''). In other words,
$\op{\mathbb{J}}$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pwHamiltonian}
  \op{\mathbb{J}} = \op{H}_T \ox \idop_S + \idop_T \ox \op{H}_S \, \text{.} 
\end{equation}
Therefore,
the evolution of the subsystem described by $\hilb{H}_S$
will only depend on ``its own''
Hamiltonian $H_S$ (assumed as time-independent), namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:ordinary_S}
  \ket{\psi(t)}_S = e^{- i \op{H}_S t / \hbar} \ket{\psi(0)}_S \text{.}  
\end{equation}
 
The overall system state
%---as the one described by $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$ in \eqref{eq:pw:finite-entanglement}---
is stationary and there is no notion
of time external to it.
This is also known as the
``timeless'' approach \parencite{Marletto:Evolution}.
\citereset
The suitable subsystem is chosen within the ``universe'' so that it acts as
\emph{clock} for the \emph{rest} of it, in the sense that
there is an observable $T$
that can be used to
describe time evolution ``without evolution''\footnote{
  The expression ``evolution without evolution''
  is directly quoted from the title of \cite{PageWootters},
  and recalled in \cite{Marletto:Evolution}.
}
of the other subsystem $\hilb{H}_S$.

Please note,
the \emph{time operator} $\op{T}$ is defined in $\hilb{H}_T$ ---and canonically conjugate to $\op{H}_T$, not $\op{H}_S$.
In other words, the time operator is defined in a different Hilbert space than the ``system of interest'' $\hilb{H}_S$,
therefore
the Pauli objection (Sec.~\ref{proof}) no longer applies. 
As we will see below, in the Page--Wootters model, time evolution is based on an internal entanglement
relation among subsystems of an isolated system
---including the case where such isolated system is the whole universe \parencite{PageWootters}.
A suitable entanglement relation ensures that 
the ``time'' measured by a clock in one system $\hilb{H}_T$ is relevant to the evolution of the other
system $\hilb{H}_S$.

% Quantitatively,
% the observable $T$ in $\hilb{H}_T$
% has eigenvalues $\tau_n$
% (assuming a discrete spectrum to simplify notation)
% which can be interpreted as possible
% instants of time in the evolution of $\ket{\psi}_S$, in the sense that
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:discrete_Tpprox}
%   \Big[ \ket{\psi(t)}_S \Big]_{t=\tau_n} = \,\,\,\, \ket{\psi_n}_S \, \text{,}
% \end{equation}
% where $\ket{\psi(t)}_S$ is given in~\eqref{eq:pw:ordinary_S} i.e.
% the evolution one would obtain in ``ordinary'' way
% by resolving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in $\hilb{H}_S$.
% Please note:
% in its original formulation, the Page--Wootters model is based on a continuous
% notion of time, and the same applies to more recent developments \parencite{Lloyd:Time}.
% A discrete formulation, as in eq. \eqref{eq:pw:discrete_Tpprox},
% will be verified numerically in Sections~\ref{sec:beyondMoreva}--\ref{sec:multiLevelClock}.

An intuitive description may be as follows.
From the perspective of the system described by $\hilb{H}_S$,
time is a parameter $t$;
however $t$ can have values
$\tau_n$ (or \emph{all} real values, in a continuous model)
which are also eigenvalues of an observable $T$ defined in \emph{another} space $\hilb{H}_T$,
with which it is entangled. Such entanglement relation establishes a correspondence
between ``instants of time'' (eigenvalues and eigenstates of observable $T$)
and (``evolved'') states in $\hilb{H}_S$.
% Thus, time can be regarded as a quantum observable,
% although defined in a different Hilbert space than the one of the Hamiltonian of interest.
% As $H_S$ and $T$ acts on two different Hilbert spaces, the Pauli objection is no longer valid
% (how canonical conjugation and uncertainty relations hold will be clearer in Sec.~\ref{sec:pw:uncertainty}).

The symbols $\hilb{H}_T$ % and $\hilb{H}_S$
naturally indicates
the Hilbert spaces where a time operator $\op{T}$ is defined,
while $\hilb{H}_S$ indicates
the ordinary Hilbert space of the \emph{S}ystem.
This notation is based on \citereset\cite{Lloyd:Time}
(where also the blackboard bold typeface, e.g. ``$\op{\mathbb{J}}$'',
is used for operators defined in a larger space
than the one of standard quantum mechanics,
typically the product $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$).
It is tempting to relate $\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$
to temporal (T) and spatial (S)
degrees of freedom, thus forming a sort of
``space-time'' (and this will be even more apparent
with a relativistic extension that will be sketched in Sec.~\ref{sec:KG}).\footnote{
  A slightly different notation
  uses $\hilb{H}_C$ and $\hilb{H}_R$
  to indicate the Hilbert spaces of the clock (C) and the rest (R) of the ``universe''
  (or isolated system):
  see, for example, \cite{Marletto:Evolution}.
}

%% \section{Development of the Formalism}\label{sec:pw:formalism}\label{sec:pw:theory_first}

The paper by Giovannetti, Lloyd and Maccone \citereset\parencite{Lloyd:Time}
was published about three decades after the original work
of Page and Wootters \parencite{PageWootters},
developing the model further and,
in particular,
addressing technical issues which have been raised meanwhile.

% Note that both papers deal with a continuous notion of time
% (the spectrum of the time operator include all $t \in \mathbb{R}$).
% A time operator with a discrete, finite spectrum was introduced at the beginning of this Section
% only for simplicity.

% In this formulation,
% in addition to the ordinary Hilbert space of the system,
% an extra Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_T$ is considered,
% where time is an observable
% represented by a self-adjoint operator.
% The ordinary Hilbert space can be labeled $\mathcal{H}_S$;
% and we consider the tensor product space $\mathcal{H}_T \otimes \mathcal{H}_S$ as
% the space in which both time and position are observables, and they act as
% $T \otimes \idop_S$ and $\idop_T \otimes X$
% respectively.

% As explained in \cite{Lloyd:Time, Maccone:Pauli}, the overall Hamiltonian,
% encompassing both position and time as observables, is given by
% [{\color{red} TODO}: this (and discussion around) redundant with eq.~\eqref{eq:pw:redundant_J}?]\begin{equation}\label{eq:pwHamiltonian}
%   \op{\mathbb{J}} = \hbar\op{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_T\ox\op{H}_S \,\text{,}
% \end{equation}
% where $\hbar\op{\Omega}$ is the canonically conjugate to the operator $\op{T}$ in $\hilb{H}_T$.
% Also, the \term{Wheeler-DeWitt equation} holds:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt}
%   \op{\mathbb{J}}\dket{\Psi} = 0 \,\text{,}
% \end{equation}
% describing a \emph{static} universe, where evolution is only
% in terms of relations between parts of a multipartite system
% (a ``clock'' and ``the rest'').

The ``conventional'' state $\ket{\psi(t)}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$
can be obtained from $\dket{\Psi}$ via partial inner product\footnote{
  For the partial inner product,
  see Definition \ref{def:pBra} and \ref{def:pKet},
  and \cite[\s 1.3.3]{QMT_Jacobs}.
}
with a time eigenstate $\prescript{}{T}{\bra{t}}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \ket{\psi(t)}_S = \prescript{}{T}{\bradket{t}{\Psi}} \, \text{.}
\end{equation*}
The function $ t \rightarrow \ket{\psi(t)}_S \; $ is the
``wavefunction in time representation'', in analogy
with the wavefunction in position representation of standard quantum mechanics.
The state vector $\dket{\Psi}$ is univocally identified by the ``coefficients'' $\ket{\psi(t)}_S$
with respect to the basis $\setof{\ket{t}_T}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:}
  \dket{\Psi} = \int \dd{t} \ket{t}_T \ox \ket{\psi(t)}_S \, \text{,}
\end{equation}
somewhat similar to the well known expression $\ket{\psi}_S = \int \dd{x} \psi_{S}(x) \ket{x}_S$
which defines the position representation.


Under this time representation (or $T$ representation), the operator $\hbar\op{\Omega}$,
canonically conjugate to the time operator $\op{T}$, is expressed as $-i\hbar\pdv{t}$,
and the commutation relation
$[\op{T}, \op{\Omega}] \repr_{T} \comm{t, -i\hbar\pdv{t}}{} = i\hbar$
can be proven
immediately, similarly to the well known position-momentum relation
$\comm{\op{x}}{\op{p}} \repr_{x} \comm{x}{-i\hbar\pdv{x}} = i\hbar$.
Thus, $\hbar\op{\Omega}$ can be seen as similar to a ``linear momentum''
in the Hilbert space of time.

%% \hbar\Omega is -E ... and \Omega \repr -i t-derivative ... and [T, \Omega] = i .

Using the $T$ representation in $\hilb{H}_T$,
and comparing \eqref{eq:pwHamiltonian} and \eqref{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:schrod_from_pw}
  0 = \qty(\hbar\op{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_{T}\ox\op{H}_S)\dket{\Psi}
    \repr -i\hbar\pdv{t}\ket{\psi(t)}_{S} + \op{H}_S\ket{\psi(t)}_{S}
    \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
we recover the usual form of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in $H_S$
(see also \cite[709--710]{Wootters:Loyola}).

Here $\op{\Omega}$ can be seen as a ``frequency operator''
represented as $-i\pdv{t}$ and having as eigenfunctions
those functions evolving in time with a phase factor $e^{i \omega t}$ only.

From another point of view, $\op{H}_{T} = \hbar\op{\Omega}$ is the ``Hamiltonian'' of $\hilb{H}_T$,
in that it plays a similar role of $H_S$ in the construction of
$\op{\mathbb{J}}$ in \eqref{eq:pwHamiltonian}.\footnote{
  Some authors (e.g. in \citereset\cite{Wootters:Loyola})
  use the symbol $H_C$ (where the subscript ``$C$'' stands for ``clock'') in place of
  $\hbar\op{\Omega}$, to emphasize this.
}

Such analogies among operators in $\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$ are summarized in Table \ref{tbl:op_comparison_pw}.

% It would be interesting to a study relativistic extension of the
% Page and Wootters model that allows, for example, the derivation of the Klein-Gordon
% equation, thus eliminating the asimmetry between
% $\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$ (and momentum and energy as well).

In the bipartite universe, physical kets $\dket{\Psi}$ can have a Schmidt decomposition
made up of
eigenstates of $\op{\Omega}$ in $\hilb{H}_T$
entangled, respectively, with
eigenstates of $\op{H}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$;
or eigenstates of $\op{T}$ in $\hilb{H}_T$
entangled with time-evolved spatial states~$\ket{\psi(t)}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:time_freq_nomu}
  \dket{\Psi} =
    \int \dd{\omega} \, \ket{\omega}_{T}\ox\ket{\Phi(\omega)}_{S} =
    \int \dd{t} \, \ket{t}_{T} \ox \ket{\psi(t)}_{S} \text{.}
\end{equation}
%
% \begin{tcolorbox}
%   Eq.~\eqref{eq:pw:time_freq_mu} here is based on \cite[eq. 10]{Lloyd:Time}.
%   The paper, in the first integral,
%   would use a ``measure'' $\dd{\mu(\omega)}$, instead of simply $\dd{\omega}$.
%   This is to take into account that not all values of $\omega$ necessarily contribute
%   to the integral: in particular if $\hbar\omega$ is not in the spectrum of $\op{H}_S$,
%   the corresponding integrand would be zero.
%
%   So,
%   I can certainly remove $\dd{\mu(\omega)}$ as requested\footnote{
%     I actually even wrote $\dd{\omega}\mu(\omega)$ in my previous draft,
%     somewhat incorrectly:\linebreak
%     technically I should have written $\dd{\mu(\omega)}$,
%     or $\dd{\omega}\mu'(\omega)$ (with a ``prime'')
%     so that $\dd{\mu(\omega)} = \frac{\dd{\mu}}{\dd{\omega}}\dd{\omega} = \mu'(\omega) \dd{\omega}$
%     to match the paper,
%     but that's probably not the most important point here\dots
%   },
%   and simply write $\dd{\omega}$, but at least I need to specify what follows:
%   %
%   that, while it is $\braket{\psi(t)}_S = 1 \ \forall t \in \mathbb{R}$
%   (unitary evolution, as in standard~QM),
%   one should not necessarily expect that
%   $\ket{\phi(\omega)}_S$ has norm $1$ for every real value of $\omega$.
%   Actually, given that the spectrum of $\op{H}_S$ is bounded from below,
%   certainly there are values of $\omega$ for which $\ket{\phi(\omega)}_S = \nullvector$.
%
%   In other words, we can certainly remove $\mu(\omega)$, but it must be ``absorbed''
%   in the properties of $\ket{\phi(\omega)}_S$.
% \end{tcolorbox}
Note that,
while it is $\braket{\psi(t)}_S = 1 \ \forall t \in \mathbb{R}$ (unitary evolution,
as in standard quantum mechanics),
one should not necessarily expect that
$\ket{\Phi(\omega)}_S$ has norm~$1$ for each real value of $\omega$.
In particular, if $\hbar\omega$ is not in the spectrum of $\op{H}_S$,
then $\ket{\Phi(\omega)}_S = \nullvector$, the vector does not contribute to the integral.
Given that the spectrum of $\op{H}_S$ is bounded from below,
certainly there are values of $\omega$ for which this is the case.
With these considerations, eq. \eqref{eq:pw:time_freq_nomu}, with regards to the first integral, may also be reformulated as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:time_freq_mu}
  \dket{\Psi} =
    \int \dd{\omega} \mu(\omega) \ket{\omega}_{T} \ox \ket{\phi(\omega)}_{S} \text{,}
\end{equation}
with $\ket{\phi(\omega)}_{S}$ normalized for any real value of $\omega$
--- see also \cite[eq.~(10)]{Lloyd:Time}.
This notation will be useful in the following example.

\subsection{Example: Hamiltonian eigenstate}

An extreme case for the distribution % $\ket{\phi(\omega)}_{S}$ in eq. \eqref{eq:pw:time_freq_nomu} ---or
$\mu(\omega)$ in \eqref{eq:pw:time_freq_mu} % ---
is, as an example, what in standard quantum mechanics would be the time evolution of an energy eigenstate
(or an eigenstate of $\op{H}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$, within the Page--Wootters formalism).
Let the related eigenvalue be $E_0 \eqbydef \hbar\omega_{0}$.

The corresponding ``history vector''
\begin{align*}
  \dket{\Psi_0} = \int \dd{t} \ket{t}_T \ox \ket{\psi_0(t)}_S %% = \int \dd{t} \ket{t}_T \ox \E^{-\iu \omega_0 (t-t_0)} \ket{\psi_0(t_0)}_S
  \text{,} \, & 
  \\
              & \text{with} \;
  \op{H}_S \ket{\psi_0(t)} = E_0 \ket{\psi_0(t)} \text{,} \;  \forall t \in \mathbb{R} \text{,}
\end{align*}
is also an egienstate of $\idop_T \ox \op{H}_S$, related to the same eigenvalue:
\[
  \qty(\idop_T \ox \op{H}_S) \dket{\Psi_0} = \int \dd{t} \ket{t}_T \ox E_0 \ket{\psi_{0}(t)}_S = E_0 \dket{\Psi_0} \text{.}
\]

In order to statisfy eq. \eqref{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt} and \eqref{eq:pwHamiltonian},
$\dket{\Psi_0}$ must also be an eigenvector of $\hbar\op{\Omega} \ox \idop$,
but related to the \emph{opposite} eigenvalue $-E_0 = -\hbar\omega_0$.

From eq.~\eqref{eq:pw:time_freq_mu}, we can write, in particular:
\begin{equation}
  \dket{\Psi_0} =
    \int \dd{\omega} \mu_0(\omega) \ket{\omega}_{T} \ox \ket{\phi_0(\omega)}_{S} \text{,}
\end{equation}
which expands $\dket{\Psi_0}$ over a continuous orthonormal eigenbasis
$\setof{\ket{\omega}_{T} \ox \ket{\phi_0(\omega)}_{S}}$
of $\op{\Omega} \ox \idop_S$.
But $\dket{\Psi_0}$ is an eigenvector itself,
for the eigenvalue $-\omega_0$,
therefore the coefficients $\mu_0(\omega)$ must be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:mudelta}
  \mu_0(\omega) = \delta\qty(\omega - \qty(-\omega_0) ) = \delta\qty(\omega + \omega_0) \text{.}
\end{equation}

Now, from \eqref{eq:pw:mudelta} and \eqref{eq:pw:time_freq_mu} it holds:
\[
  \dket{\Psi_0} = \int \dd{\omega} \delta(\omega + \omega_0) \ket{\omega}_T \ox \ket{\phi(\omega)}_S =
    \ket{-\omega_0}_T \ox \ket{\phi(-\omega_0)}_S \text{,}
\]
then, using the relations
$
\, \prescript{}{T}{\braket{t}{t'}}_T = \delta(t-t') \,
$
and
$
  \,
  \ket{\omega}_T =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\dd{t}\E^{\iu\omega t}\ket{t}_T
  \,
$
(see also \cite[2]{Lloyd:Time}),
it follows that\footnote{%
  Please note the analogy with the well-known
  inner product of position and momentum eigenvectors in standard quantum mechanics:
  $\braket{\vb{x}}{\vb{p}} = (2\pi\hbar)^{-3/2}\E^{\iu \vb{p} \vdot \vb{x}  / \hbar}$
  (or $\braket{x}{p} = \frac{\E^{\iu p x / \hbar}}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}}$ for one-dimensional systems).
  See, for example, \cite[126--127]{Ballentine}.
}
\[
  \prescript{}{T}{\braket{t}{\omega}}_T =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\prescript{}{T}{\bra{t}} \int\dd{t'}\E^{\iu\omega t'}\ket{t'}_T  =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int\dd{t'}\E^{\iu\omega t'}\delta(t-t') =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \E^{\iu\omega t} \; \text{;}
\]
therefore the \emph{evolution} (in $\hilb{H}_S$) is
\begin{equation}
  \ket{\psi(t)}_S = \prescript{}{T}{\bradket{t}{\Psi_0}} = \prescript{}{T}{\braket{t}{-\omega_0}}_{T} \ket{\phi(-\omega_0)}_S =
    \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \E^{-\iu\omega_0 t} \ket{\phi(-\omega_0)}_S \text{.}
\label{eq:pw:stat_eigenst_of_H_S}
\end{equation}
By evaluating and comparing eq. \eqref{eq:pw:stat_eigenst_of_H_S} at two arbitrary instants of time
$t_0$~and~$t$,
one easily gets
$\ket{\psi(t)}_{S} = \E^{-\iu\omega_{0}(t-t_{0})} \ket{\psi(t_0)}_{S}$,
which is the expected stationary evolution for an energy eigenstate in quantum mechanics. 

\subsection{Normalizable vectors of $\pwspace$}
\label{sec:properpw}

A vector $\dket{\Psi}$ in $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$,
satisfying \eqref{eq:pwHamiltonian} and \eqref{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt},
encodes the whole (unitary) time evolution of a system.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pwexpansion}
  \dket{\Psi} =
    \int \dd{t} \ket{t}_T \ox \ket{\psi(t)}_S =
    \int \dd{t}\dd[3]{\vec{r}} \ \Psi(t; \vec{r}) \; \ket{t}_T \ox \ket{\vec{r}}_S
    \,  \text{,}
\end{equation}
with $\ket{\vec{r}}_S$ eigenstate of the position observable in $\hilb{H}_S$,
so that $\Psi(t; \vec{r})$ can be regarded as the wavefunction in position representation of the system at time $t$,
in ordinary quantum mechanics terms.
We know $\setof{\ket{t}_T \ox \ket{\vec{r}}_S}$ is an othonormal basis of $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$, therefore
\begin{equation}
  \norm{\dket{\Psi}}^2 =
    \int \dd{t}\dd[3]{\vec{r}} \ \abs{\Psi(t; \vec{r})}^2 =
    \int \dd{t} \int \dd[3]{\vec{r}} \ \abs{\Psi(t; \vec{r})}^2 =
    \int \dd{t} 1 \rightarrow +\infty
    \,  \text{,}
\end{equation}
which means that such $\dket{\Psi}$ is an \term{improper} vector of $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$.

Proper (i.e. normalizable) states are described in \citereset\cite{Lloyd:Time} as well, by replacing (or generalizing)
the \eqref{eq:pwexpansion} with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pwphi}
  \dket{\Phi} =
    \int \dd{t} \phi(t) \ket{t}_T \ox \ket{\psi(t)}_S \, \text{.}
\end{equation}
If the function $\phi \in \mathscr{L}^2(\mathbb{R})$,
then $\dket{\Psi}$ is a proper element of the product space,
and $\norm{\dket{\Psi}}^2 = \int \dd{t} \abs{\phi(t)}^2$.

The case of non-normalizable $\dket{\Psi}$ in \eqref{eq:pwphi},
with normalized $\ket{\psi(t)}_S$ $\forall t \in \mathbb{R}$,
describes the unitary evolution, as seen throughout Chapter \ref{ch:pw}.
As observed in \cite{Maccone:QGR},
``%
  Quantum mechanics is formulated in terms of \emph{systems},
  typically limited in space but infinitely extended in time%
''.
If the state vector is \emph{conditioned} at a particular time $t$,
it holds $\norm{_{T}\bradket{t}{\Psi}}_S = \norm{\ket{\psi(t)}}_S = 1$,
meaning that, at each $t$,
\emph{the particle must certainly be in some (one) point in space}.

A normalized $\dket{\Psi}$ in the whole $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$,
instead,
can be interpreted as a total probability of~$1$ in both space and time combined.
It can be interpreted as describing an \term{event},
in that it
must certainly be in some point in space
\emph{and} time (in terms of outcome of an idealized measurement\footnote{
  Measurement in quantum mechanics requires the concepts
  of state of the system
  (and measurement apparatus)
  \emph{before} and \emph{after} the measurement and, therefore, the existence
  of an external time (external with respect of the Hilbert space of states).
  This logically contradicts the foundation of the Page--Wootters model if
  time itself is measured as a quantum observable. $\dket{\Psi} \in \pwspace$
  embeds the whole history of a system and therefore cannot have a
  ``before'' neither an ``after'' the measurement, ``when'' it collapses
  into an eigenstate of time. The apparent contradicion is resolved
  stressing that probability amplitues are intended in the sense of
  \emph{conditional} probabilities e.g. \emph{provided that the particle
  is in position} $x \in X$ (or the detector clicks)
  what is the probability density amplitude of time being (the clock showing) $t$?
  Consistently, the Bayes rule
  (see, for example, \cite{Stat:Conditional})
  is invoked in the following sections
  and references.

Such states have no correspondence with standard quantum mechanics states and their unitary evolution.

TODO: move here the open-quantum-system-uncertainty stuff? (now commented out in source).
