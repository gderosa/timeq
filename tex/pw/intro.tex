\section{Introduction}

To introduce the Page--Wootters model, let us first consider
a bipartite system $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$,
the two subsystems of which have, for example, finite dimension $N$,
and are completely
entangled, i.e.
$$
  \hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B \ni \dket{\Psi}
  =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ket{\tau_{n}}_{A} \ox \ket{\psi_{n}}_{B} \text{,}
$$
where
a ``double angle braket'' notation $\dket{\Psi}$ has been adopted
for vectors in the tensor product space $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$;
$\ket{\psi_{n}}_{B}$ are normalized states vectors in $\hilb{H}_B$;
and
$\qty{\ket{{\tau}_n}}$ is an eigenbasis of some observable (say, $T$) in system A.
The overall state $\dket{\Psi}$ is stationary, meaning it is an eigenstate
of the overall Hamiltonian of $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$:
$$
  \mathbb{J} \dket{\Psi} = \epsilon \dket{\Psi} \text{.}
$$

If we regard this observable as ``the position of the hand of a clock'',
the state of system B can be regarded as a function of the ``parameter'' $n$,
which is also an index labeling
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a quantum observable
with its own Hermitian operator.
Thus the relation between quantum systems A and B is thus regarded as
a ``time evolution'' of system B,
while the whole bipartite system
is in a stationary state
$\ket{\Psi}$.
There is no logical requirement that $\ket{\Psi}$
depends, other than trivially,
upon any further external parameter.
The stationary state $\ket{\Psi}$ embeds the whole ``history''
of subsystem B.

\subsection*{Notation}

In this and following chapters, when treating quantum time models,
$\hilb{H}_S$ will indicate the Hilbert space of ordinary quantum mechanics.
$\hilb{H}_T$, an extra space where a time operator $\hat{T}$ is introduced. The tensor
product space $\pwspace$
will often be referred to as well.
Bras and kets in this tensor product space will be indicated with a special double-angle-bracket
notation, as in $\dket{\Psi}$.

${\mathbb{J}}$ (blackboard bold) indicates an  operator defined in
a larger space than the one of standard quantum mechanics,
typically the product $\pwspace$.

The symbol `$\repr$', as in $\hat{A} \repr \mqty(a&b\\c&d)$, $\ket{\psi} \repr \mqty[\alpha \\ \beta]$
means: representation with respect to a particular basis (as opposed to intrinsic equality `$=$').

The symbol `$\eqbydef$'
means: equal by definition, equal by settings i.e. postulated and not derived logically.
