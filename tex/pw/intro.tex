\section{Introduction}

To introduce the Page--Wootters model, let us first consider
a bipartite system $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$,
the two subsystems of which have finite dimension\footnote{
  As it will be clearer later in the Chapter,
  this example is simplified for the sake of the argument: in principle
  the system may be infinite-dimensional;
  the sum may be replaced by an integral (continuous spectrum),
  and the vector in the tensor-product space may be not normalizable (an improper vector).
}$N$,
and are completely
entangled, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:finite-entanglement}
  \hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B \ni \dket{\Psi}
  =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ket{\tau_{n}}_{A} \ox \ket{\psi_{n}}_{B} \text{.}
\end{equation}
Here
a ``double angle braket'' notation $\dket{\Psi}$ has been adopted
for vectors in the tensor product space $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$.
We assume $\ket{\psi_{n}}_{B}$ are all \emph{normalized} in $\hilb{H}_B$;
and
$\qty{\ket{{\tau}_n}}$ is an orthonormal eigenbasis of some observable (say, $T$) in system A.
Let also $\dket{\Psi}$ be \emph{stationary}, meaning it is an eigenstate
of the overall Hamiltonian $\mathbb{J}$ in $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$:
$$
  \mathbb{J} \dket{\Psi} = \epsilon \dket{\Psi} \text{.}
$$
Finally, we assume that the two subsystems $A$ and $B$ are \emph{non interacting},
meaning that the global Hamiltonian $\mathbb{J}$ can be expressed as a sum of two terms
which only act on the respective subspaces $\hilb{H}_A$ and $\hilb{H}_B$
(and there is no explicit ``interaction term''). In other words,
$\mathbb{J}$ can be expressed as
$$
  \mathbb{J} = H_A \ox \idop_B + \idop_A \ox H_B \, \text{.} 
$$
Therefore, with the ordinary notion of ``time as a paramerter'' in quantum mechanics,
the evolution of system B will only depend on ``its own'' Hamiltonian $H_B$, namely
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:ordinary_B}
  \ket{\psi(t)}_B = e^{- i \hbar t / H_B } \ket{\psi(0)}_B \text{.}  
\end{equation}
 
In the Page--Wootters model, time evolution is based on an internal entanglement
relation among subsystems of an isolated system,
including the case of the whole universe \parencite{PageWootters}.
The overall system
---as the one described by $\hilb{H}_A \ox \hilb{H}_B$ in \eqref{eq:pw:finite-entanglement}---
is stationary and there is no notion
of time external to it.
This is also known as the
``timeless'' approach \parencite{Marletto:Evolution}.
\citereset
Within this approach,
a suitable subsystem is chosen within the ``universe'' so that it acts as
\emph{clock} for the \emph{rest} of it, in the sense that
there is an observable $T$ (as in the above example, in system $A$)
that can be used to
describe time evolution ``without evolution'' of system $B$
---where the expression ``evolution without evolution''
is taken directly from the original Page and Wootters paper just mentioned,
and recalled in \cite{Marletto:Evolution} as well.

Quantitatively, within the example of eq.~\eqref{eq:pw:finite-entanglement},
the observable $T$ in $\hilb{H}_A$
has eigenvalues $\tau_n$ which can be interpreted as possible
instants of time in the evolution of $\ket{\psi}_B$, in the sense that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:discrete_approx}
  \Big[ \ket{\psi(t)}_B \Big]_{t=\tau_n} \approx \,\,\,\, \ket{\psi_n}_B \, \text{,}
\end{equation}
where $\ket{\psi(t)}_B$ is the same of~\eqref{eq:pw:ordinary_B} i.e.
the evolution one would obtain in ``ordinary'' way
by simply resolving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in system B, with Hamiltonian $H_B$.
Please note in eq.~\eqref{eq:pw:discrete_approx} we do not use strict equality:
in its original formulation the Page--Wooters model is still based on a continuous
notion of time, and the same applies to more recent developments \parencite{Lloyd:Time}; hence
it cannot be assumed, at this stage, that a discrete-clock model
is even a reasonable approximation.
Only later in the present work, however, numerical
simulation will show in fact an excellent agreement on a number of example systems.

\subsection*{Notation}

In this and following chapters, when treating quantum time models,
$\hilb{H}_S$ will indicate the Hilbert space of ordinary quantum mechanics.
$\hilb{H}_T$, an extra space where a time operator $\hat{T}$ is introduced. The tensor
product space $\pwspace$
will often be referred to as well.
Bras and kets in this tensor product space will be indicated with a special double-angle-bracket
notation, as in $\dket{\Psi}$.

${\mathbb{J}}$ (blackboard bold) indicates an  operator defined in
a larger space than the one of standard quantum mechanics,
typically the product $\pwspace$.

The symbol `$\repr$', as in $\hat{A} \repr \mqty(a&b\\c&d)$, $\ket{\psi} \repr \mqty[\alpha \\ \beta]$
means: representation with respect to a particular basis (as opposed to intrinsic equality `$=$').

The symbol `$\eqbydef$'
means: equal by definition, equal by settings i.e. postulated and not derived logically.
