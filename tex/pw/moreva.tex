The Page and Wootters model has been illustrated experimentally in recent years,
with a very simple toy universe consisting of just one qubit acting as ``the system'' (or
``the rest of the universe'' if we will), and the clock being implemented by another qubit ---
physically, the polarization states of two photons \parencite{Moreva:synthetic,Moreva:illustration}).

In another experiment by the same authors \parencite{Moreva_position}, $\hilb{H}_S$ is still implemented with 
polarizations $\ket{H}$ or $\ket{V}$ of a photon, while the clock states in $\hilb{H}_T$
are given by the \emph{position} of the same photon along the conventional $x$ axis.

The latter is interesting because it implements a continuous time,
which, among other things, allows identifying a canonically conjugate observable
$\op{\Omega}$. Or, conversely, a time operator $\op{T}$, once $\op{\Omega}$ is given.
More precisely, it is impossible to satisfy \eqref{eq:canonical_commutation_in_time}
in a finite-dimension Hilbert space, because the operators
cannot be both bounded \parencite{Weyl:FiniteComm}.

On the other hand, one problematic aspect of the experiment with continuous time
is that
it relies on \term{photon position} which is another
still controversial topic (see, for example, \cite{HawtonPhotonPosition}),
similar, in that regards, to the quest for a quantum time operator that the experiment is trying to solve.

Just like time in quantum mechanics, position coordinates in quantum optics and other field theories
are (classical) external parameters and not quantum observables.

However, the experiment in \cite{Moreva_position} verifies the violation of
\term{Legget-Garg inequalities}, as previously suggested in \cite{LeggettGarg+PageWootters},
for ``time'' measurement results
(In our notation, Leggett-Garg inequalities are to $\hilb{H}_T$ what the well known Bell inequalities
  are to $\hilb{H}_S$).
This proves the ``quantumness'' of this realization of Page and Wootters time,
regardless of the explicit expression of the corresponding operator (which, unsurprisingly,
is not given). It's tempting to infer that the experiment
rather tests Bell/Leggett-Garg inequalities for photon position.

The first experiment, on the other hand \parencite{Moreva:illustration,Moreva:synthetic},
uses (uncontroversial)
two-level quantum systems for both the clock and the rest of the universe.
While we can't derive a $\op{T}$ such that $[\op{T}, \op{\Omega}] = i$
because of the finite dimension of the space, both $\op{\Omega}$
and $\op{H}_S$ are given an explicit expression:
\begin{align}\label{eq:MorevaOmegaT}
  \op{\Omega}            &= i\omega(\ketbra{H}{V}- \ketbra{V}{H})_T \\
  \op{H}_S/{\hbar}       &= i\omega(\ketbra{H}{V}- \ketbra{V}{H})_S
  \,\text{,}
\end{align}
as well as a zero-eigenstate of $\mathbb{J}$ (as in eq. \ref{eq:pwHamiltonian}):
\begin{equation}
  \dket{\Psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\qty(\ket{H}_T\ket{V}_S-\ket{V}_T\ket{H}_S)
  \,\text{.}
\end{equation}

It can be easily verified that the Wheeler-DeWitt condition
\eqref{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt} is satisfied.

In general, given a clock ($\op{\Omega}$), the problem of finding a
``rest of the universe'' ($\op{H}_S$) such that
$\hbar\op{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_T\ox\op{H}_S = 0$
(and vice versa)
is not trivial
(and it's particularly cumbersome in non-relativisitc
quantum mechanics where we can't avail of negative energies etc.).
Most literature focuses their examples on clocks only
\parencite{Prvanovic,RealisticClocks,HarmonicClocks},
implicitly relying on the scale of a realistic universe
in order to have the \eqref{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt} satisfied
(which was originally derived using General Relativity arguments)
but missing the opportunity to illustrate the entanglement mechanism in detail,
which is aimed at, instead, in the present work, to some extent.
