\section{Introduction}

The Page and Wootters model is based on
an additional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_T$,
where time is an observable
represented by a self-adjoint operator
whose properties are similar to the ones of position
in ordinary quantum mechanics
\parencite{Lloyd:Time, Maccone:Pauli}.

In this language, the ordinary Hilbert space can be labeled $\mathcal{H}_S$;
and we consider the product space $\mathcal{H}_T \otimes \mathcal{H}_S$ as
the space in which both time and position are observables, and they act as
$\hat{t} \otimes \idop_S$ and $\idop_T \otimes \hat{x}$
respectively.

\begin{remark}
  In a more ``relativistic friendly'' notation, we may set
  $\hat{x_0} = c\hat{t}$ and consider
  $\hat{x_0} \otimes \idop_S$ and $\idop_T \otimes \hat{x_1}$,
  and so on. An interesting development may be expressing
  Lorentz transformations as unitary transformations in
  $\mathcal{H}_T \otimes \mathcal{H}_S$.
\end{remark}

The Page and Wootters mechanism is rooted in the ``problem of time''
in quantum cosmology.
In principle, an approriate system (a ``clock'') can be identified in such a way
to be described in $\mathcal{H}_T$, while $\mathcal{H}_S$ describes
the quantum states of \emph{the rest of the universe} \parencite{Marletto:Evolution}.

As explained in \cite{Lloyd:Time, Maccone:Pauli}, the overall Hamiltonian,
encompassing both position and time as observables, is given by
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbb{J}} = \hbar\hat{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_T\ox\hat{H}_S \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
while the \term{Wheeler-DeWitt equation} holds:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbb{J}}\dket{\Psi} = 0 \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
describing a \emph{static} universe, where evolution is only
in terms of relations between parts of a multipartite system
(a ``clock'' and ``the rest'').



\section{Theoretical developments following Moreva et al. experiment}

And an experiment: \cite{Moreva:synthetic,Moreva:illustration}.
Some theoretical implications of the experiment are reviewed in
\cite{LeggettGarg+PageWootters}.

And a NEW experiment! \parencite{Moreva_position}.

\section{Prvanovic and P\&W}
In \cite{Prvanovic}, essentially the clock observable is the Hamiltonian.
The two example clocks are an harmonic oscillator and a free particle.
The harmonic oscillator features discrete time. Generally a time which is
{bounded from below}
is consistent with the Big Bang...

Prvanovic uses ``relativisitc'' constants...

Ciao.

\section{Analyze latest Moreva experiment with previous ones}

Let's consider a photon, as a two level system with its two linear polarization
sates $\ket{H}, \ket{V}$;
and the Hamiltonian
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{H}=i\hbar\omega\qty(\ket{H}\ket{V}-\ket{V}\ket{H})\,\text{.}
\end{equation}
There has:
\[
  \mathcal{H}^n \ket{H, V} = \begin{cases}
      \hbar^n\omega^n\ket{H, V} &\text{for n even} \\
    -i\hbar^n\omega^n\ket{V, H} &\text{for n odd}
  \end{cases}
\]

\section{Entanglement and decoherence (Arrow of time)}
See also \cite{EntanglementVsDecoherence}.

Decoherence is an irreversible process, it also happens in measurement.

According to Marletto and Vedral, arrow of time is increase in Entanglement
between the clock and the rest.

So, there seems to be a contradiction: is entanglement ``decreasing''
(i.e. destroyed by decoherence) with time
or increasing?

We can avoid the contradiction saying that
entanglement between two finite systems is
destroyed while the entanglement of each of them with the universe
is increasing.

\section{TODOs}

TODO: \cite{RealisticClocks}.

\cite{HarmonicClocks} concludes ``Classical clock can be described by an Hamiltonian linear in momentum''\dots
like in relativity?

Extra: \cite{TimeAnyons}.

TODO: use the harmonic oscillator in \cite{HarmonicClocks}
as a PaW clock for the same packet that is measured in
Ruschhaupt's detector model.
Therein, fading wave function: is minus derivative an event?
L4 normalized?

Other systems of interest: decays. Prvanovic new.

TQM Book: time of residence: applicable to qubits, therefore Moreva experiment.
