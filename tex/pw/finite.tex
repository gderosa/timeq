The experiment mentioned in Sec. \ref{sec:pw:qubit}
is based on a two-level clock
The ``frequency'' observable is defined and implemented experimentally
but the \emph{time} operator is not defined or calculated.
In finite-dimension Hilbert spaces
there are diffilcuties in identifying canonically conjugate
pairs and one cannot use the same explicit formalism
that would be used for observables with a continuous spectrum.
Moreover, operators satisfying a canonical
commutation relation like eq.~\eqref{eq:canonical_commutation_in_time}
cannot be both bounded, which excludes finit-dimensional systems.

This problem was studied in detail in
\cite{FiniteHilb}. It was shown therein
that statisfying the canonical commutation relation 
is not essential to build operators representing physical observables
with the same role of position and momentum.\footnote{
  Or $T$ and $\hbar\Omega$
  in $\hilb{H}_T$ for a finite-dimensional Page and Wootters model.
}

Discrete, bounded position-like and momentum-like operators can be obtained from
each other via
the \term{finite Fourier transform}.
In our case, we are particularly interested in relating the
time operator $\op{T}$ and the ``energy'' operator $\hbar\op{\Omega}$
in $\hilb{H}_T$ ---which in the continuous limit would satisfy the
\eqref{eq:canonical_commutation_in_time} exactly.

It holds\footnote{
  Contrary to what indicated in eq. (8) of \cite{FiniteHilb},
  it can be easily verified that,
  if $ \op{p} = F x F^{\dagger} $,
  the correct inverse relation is
  $ x = F^{\dagger} p F$ and not $ -x = F p F^{\dagger} $.
} \parencite{FiniteHilb}:
\begin{gather}\label{eq:FourierCanonicalRelations}
  \op{\Omega} = F \op{T} F^{\dagger}\text{;} \quad
  \op{T} = F^{\dagger} \op{\Omega} F
\end{gather}
where, in the ``position'' (or \emph{time}) finite eigenbasis,
\begin{equation}
  F = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{m,n=0}^{N-1} \exp[i\frac{2\pi mn}{N}] \ketbra{m}{n} \, \text{,}
\end{equation}
while in the frequency eigenbasis
\begin{equation}
  F^{\dagger} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\mu,\nu=0}^{N-1} \exp[-i\frac{2\pi \mu\nu}{N}] \ketbra{\mu}{\nu} \, \text{,}
\end{equation}
with $N$ being the finite dimension of the Hilbert space.

Please note the \eqref{eq:FourierCanonicalRelations} is valid in normalized (``natural'') units
where ``time'' and ``frequency'' are in fact respectively
\term{samples} and \emph{cycles/samples rate},
in a similar sense as in digital signal processing theory
\parencite[pp. 469, 490]{Signal}.

In SI units, the \eqref{eq:FourierCanonicalRelations} is replaced by
\begin{gather}
  \label{eq:SI_Fourier:Omega}
    \op{\Omega} = \frac{2\pi}{N(\delta T)^2} F \op{T} F^{\dagger} = \frac{2\pi N}{\qty(\Delta T)^2} F \op{T} F^{\dagger} \\
  \label{eq:SI_Fourier:T}
    \op{T} = \frac{2\pi}{N(\delta\Omega)^2} F^{\dagger} \op{\Omega} F = \frac{2\pi N}{\qty(\Delta\Omega)^2} F^{\dagger} \op{\Omega} F
  \, \text{,}
\end{gather}
where $\delta T$ (and analogously $\delta\Omega$)
is the size of a ``temporal sample'', or the size of a discrete
time step in the clock, and $\Delta T = N\delta T$ the range of the clock.
For example,
$\delta T = \text{1 hour}$ and $\Delta T=12\;\text{hours}$
for a common clock (hours hand) in our everyday life.

It holds
\begin{gather}
  \delta\Omega \delta T = \frac{2\pi}{N} \, \text{;} \quad
  \Delta\Omega \Delta T = 2\pi N \, \text{.}
\end{gather}

A benefit of finite-dimensional systems is the potential implementation on a finite array of
qubits in a quantum computer. The use of Discrete Fourier Transform extends the overlap
with technology and engineering to the domain of signal processing \parencite{FiniteHilb}.
In \emph{ordinary} quantum mechanics, the Fourier transform (discrete or continuous)
is generally used
to associate wavefunctions in position and momendum space
(whereas time and frequency are \emph{not} operators),
while in communication engineering it is used to convert signals
from the time to the frequency domain and vice versa.
Thanks to the introduction of the Hilbert space $\hilb{H}_T$,
the interpretation in terms of time and frequency
(or time and energy, up to a factor $\hbar$)
is applicable to quantum theory as well, not only formally
i.e. not in the sense of a mere operation among (``classical'') parameters;
but in the sense of conversion between representations of the
same quantum state vector with respect to different eigenbasis,
in full analogy with position and momentum in $\hilb{H}_S$.

\subsection{Uncertainty in finite-dimensional systems}\label{sec:finite_uncertainty}
\citereset
For canonical pairs of operators with a continuous, unbounded spectrum i.e.
$\op{q}$ and $\op{p} \eqbydef -i\hbar\op{\partial}_{q}$,
it is in general straightforward to prove that
$\qty[\op{q}, \op{p}] = i\hbar$ and therefore
$\Delta q \Delta p \geq {\frac{1}{2} \qty|\ev{\qty[\op{q}, \op{p}]}| = \frac{\hbar}{2}}$.

In finite $d$-dimensional Hilbert spaces, the above commutation relation doesn't hold
in general, and is less essential.
Canonically conjugate operators are related
through the (discrete) Fourier transform ($\op{p} = F\op{q}F^{\dagger}$)
rather then differentiation,
and uncertainty relations are based on
the properties of Fourier transformation
rather than commutation relations.

Particularly, the entropic uncertainty relation holds
(\cite[sec.2.4]{FiniteHilb}; \cite{Deutsch:Uncertainty}):
\begin{equation}
  S_q + S_p \geq \ln d
\end{equation}
where the quantities $S_q$ and $S_p$ are the \term{R\'enyi}-\term{Shannon} entropies
\parencite[sec.{\it I}.A]{Wehner:Uncertainty}; in this case:
\begin{align}
  S_q &= -\sum_n \qty|\lambda_n |^2  \ln\qty|\lambda_n|^2 \\
  S_p &= -\sum_n \qty|\mu_n     |^2  \ln\qty|\mu_n    |^2
  \,\text{,}
\end{align}
with $\lambda_n$ and $\mu_n$ being the discrete ``wave functions'' in the
(generalized) position and momentum basis.
