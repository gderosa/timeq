\section{Three-level system}\label{sec:pw3l}

A two-level system is the simplest non-trivial quantum system and,
as we have seen in Sec. \ref{sec:absorption+pw},
it is sufficient to illustrate
models of quantum time of arrival
such as those based on complex potentials as well as relational models.
Therein it has been shown, with numerical examples, that the two approaches lead to
compatible predictions.

A three-level atom (or quantum system in general) may appear as
the next natural step, by studying a system at a (slight) further
degree of complexity; but otherwise showing esentially more of
the same physics.
