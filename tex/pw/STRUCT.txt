  Basic ideas

  Formalism: Lloyd-Giovannetti-Maccone in detail
  Normalizable vectors in H_T x H_S
  Uncertainty relations
  P-W and time-of-arrival (Leon, Maccone) (Bayesian/conditional probability)
  Discretization (using Vourdas)

  One qubit universe (Moreva experiment etc.)
  Beyond the 1+1 qubit experiment (original addition to Moreva work: T operator, diagonalization, etc.)
  Multi-level clock
  P-W and detector: 2 level system
  P-W and detector: 3 level system
