\section{Multi-Level Clock (own work)}

\subsection{Preliminaries}

A clock that can measure only two times in one cycle of a periodic evolution
is of limited interest ---and limited falsifiability, as it can be easily
interpolated by different models.
The experiment described in
\cite{Moreva:synthetic} and related works attempts at addressing the issue:
\begin{quote}
  To obtain a more interesting clock, we perform the same conditional probability measurement
  introducing varying time delays to the clock photon, implemented through quartz plates of
  variable thickness.
\end{quote}
But it's worth noting that such delay is in fact a classical external parameter.
%
In what follows, instead, our approach to a more interesting clock will be based on simply
increasing the number of levels of the clock, or in other words increasing the
finite dimension of the Hilbert space $\hilb{H}_T$. This is certainly feasible
theoretically, possibly resorting to numerical computation.
\begin{remark}
  Experimentally,
  besides looking for a suitable $N$-level system to act as a clock,
  we may want to ``encode'' $2^{n}$ levels into the combined state of $n$
  qubits and
  decompose $\mathbb{J}$ ---or, actually, $e^{-i\mathbb{J}\tau/\hbar}$---
  into simpler hamiltonians (evolutions)
  acting on individual qubits (\term{gates}),
  therefore allowing the experiment to be run on a quantum computer.\footnote{
    Nevertheless, a quantum computation model based on
    $N$-dimensional \term{qudits}
    (with $N > 2$)
    is considered in the literature \parencite{QuditComp, Qudit}
    as a possible approach to \emph{simplify} implementation
    of more general purpose quantum processors, not only specific experiments.
  }
  A decomposition method that can be considered for the purpose
  is the Trotter-Suzuki scheme
  \parencite{Trotter-Suzuki:exp, Trotter-Suzuki:GPU}.
  This is a potential line of further study.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Eigensystem in the product space and consistency with ordinary quantum \mbox{theory}}
\label{sec:building-the-discrete-pw-clock}
Appendix \ref{appendix:n-level} reports the details of
symbolic and
numeric computation for
an $N=32$-level clock, ``timing'' a qubit subject to the same hamiltonian
of the experiment we have seen in eq.~\eqref{eq:H_S}.

In this case, for simplicity, we work in
``natural units'' $\hbar = \omega = 1$, where $\omega$ is
the characteristic frequency in the same sense of the
two-level clock experiment described in Section \ref{1qubitExp}.

The clock is built as having a time operator which is diagonal in the
chosen computational basis\footnote{
  Here there's no explicit reference to any particular physical implementation. 
}:
\[
  \hat{T} \repr \frac{2\pi}{N}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0           &       &       &       \\
                &1      &       &       \\
                &       &\ddots &       \\
                &       &       &N-1
  \end{pmatrix} \,\text{.}
\]
With this choice, the clock spans the characteristic period of $\Delta T = 2\pi$.

The ``spatial space'' or ``ordinary Hilbert space'' $\hilb{H}_S$
is still 2-dimensional, and the hamiltonian in it is simply
\[
  \hat{H}_S \repr
  i
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0   & 1   \\
    -1  & 0
  \end{pmatrix}
  \, \text{.}
\]

Frequency operator $\hat{\Omega}$ is derived, analytically, via Fourier
transformation as seen in \eqref{eq:SI_Fourier:Omega}:
\[
  \hat{\Omega} = \frac{N}{2\pi} F^{}_{N} \hat{T} F^{\dagger}_{N} \, \text{.}
\]
With a large $N$,
such derivation is extremely laborious. We don't resort to
numeric FFT in this case, but we do benefit of computer-aided, yet exact
symbolic computation.

Once $\hat{\Omega}$ is derived though,
the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of
$\hat{\mathbb{J}} = \hbar\hat{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_T\ox\hat{H}_S$
can only, realistically, be computed with numerical methods.

In order to illustrate interesting examples, not corresponding to the
trivial evolution of an eigenstate of $H_S$,
but to some kind of Rabi oscillation or Larmor precession
\parencite[Ch. IV]{Cohen-Tannoudji}, we pick, in \term{Mathematica}'s ordering,
eigenvectors $\dket{\Phi_{40}}$ and $\dket{\Phi_{41}}$ of $\hat{\mathbb{J}}$
in $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_T$, corresponding to eigenvalues
$\epsilon_{40} = 12$ and $\epsilon_{41} = 11$.

Each eigenvector encodes a whole possible discrete-time history
of the qubit over a cycle,
as stated in \eqref{eq:timepicks2} or \eqref{eq:timepicksN}.

So, for example, if components $1$ and $2$ of $\dket{\Phi_{41}}$ correspond to
(the components of)
an initial state of the qubit in $\hilb{H}_S$
(i.e at ``ordinary time'' $t=0$); components
$2k + 1$ and $2k + 2$ correspond to $t = \frac{2\pi}{N}k \eqbydef t_k$
of same, $\forall k \in \qty{0, \dots, N-1}$.

A comparison of Page--Wootters results with ordinary
Schr{\"o}dinger evolution is thus given by the comparisons
\begin{align}
  \dbradket{2k+1}{\Phi_{41}} e^{-i \epsilon_{41} t_k} &\sim \braket{0}{\psi(t_k)}_{\mathrm{S}} \label{eq:comparison0} \\
  \dbradket{2k+2}{\Phi_{41}} e^{-i \epsilon_{41} t_k} &\sim \braket{1}{\psi(t_k)}_{\mathrm{S}} \label{eq:comparison1}
  \,\text{,}
\end{align}
where the phase $e^{-i \epsilon_{41} t_k}$ is motivated in \cite[sec.``The Zero-eigenvalue'']{Lloyd:Time},
and inessential if one is merely interested in determining and comparing probabilities
$\qty|\braket{0,1}{\psi}|^2$. Please note the double angle bracket notation for vectors
and algebraic operations in the product space $\hilb{H}_T \ox \hilb{H}_S$.

Figure \ref{fig:prob-comparison} is the graphical representation of (the square modulus of)
\eqref{eq:comparison0} and \eqref{eq:comparison1} i.e. the probability for the qubit
in $\hilb{H}_S$ to be $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$.

The discrete graph, on top, plots the
square modulus of components of $\hat{\mathbb{J}}$'s eigenvector $\dket{\Psi_{41}}$.

Odd-index ($2k+1$) square-modulus components
---occupying vertical \emph{spaces} on the grid---
are compared
with the Schr{\"o}dinger evolution of probability $\qty|\braket{0}{\psi}|^{2}$
(first continuos plot, middle image).

Even-index ($2k+2$) components
---occupying vertical \emph{lines} on the grid---
are analogously compared
with the Schr{\"o}dinger evolution of probability $\qty|\braket{1}{\psi}|^{2}$
(second continuos plot, bottom image).

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:complex-comparison} compares the two sides of
\eqref{eq:comparison0} and \eqref{eq:comparison1}
in terms of \emph{complex value}
(%
  therefore the term $e^{-i \epsilon t_k}$ is relevant,
  for eigenvalues $\epsilon \neq 0$ of $\hat{\mathbb{J}}$%
).
