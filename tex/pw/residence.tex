\section{In relation with the \term{time of residence}}

Here we compare \cite{Moreva:synthetic, Moreva:illustration}
(a Page and Wootters problem)
with the ``standard'' \term{time of residence}
treated in \cite[\S 5.5.2]{TQM2},
the only usable concept since there is no notion of position
for a qubit.
