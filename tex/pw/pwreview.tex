\section{Development of the Formalism}

About three decades after the first publication by
Don Page and William Wootters \parencite{PageWootters},
the model was further developed,
in particular by Lloyd, Giovannetti and Maccone,
with emphasis on addressing technical issues which have been raised meanwhile
\parencite{Lloyd:Time}.

In this formulation,
in addition to the ordinary Hilbert space of the system,
an extra Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_T$ is considered,
where time is an observable
represented by a self-adjoint operator.
The ordinary Hilbert space can be labeled $\mathcal{H}_S$;
and we consider the tensor product space $\mathcal{H}_T \otimes \mathcal{H}_S$ as
the space in which both time and position are observables, and they act as
$T \otimes \idop_S$ and $\idop_T \otimes X$
respectively.

As explained in \cite{Lloyd:Time, Maccone:Pauli}, the overall Hamiltonian,
encompassing both position and time as observables, is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pwHamiltonian}
  \op{\mathbb{J}} = \hbar\op{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_T\ox\op{H}_S \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
where $\hbar\op{\Omega}$ is the canonically conjugate to the operator $\op{T}$ in $\hilb{H}_T$.
Also, the \term{Wheeler-DeWitt equation} holds:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt}
  \op{\mathbb{J}}\dket{\Psi} = 0 \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
describing a \emph{static} universe, where evolution is only
in terms of relations between parts of a multipartite system
(a ``clock'' and ``the rest'').

% Please note the special notation $\dket{\Psi}$ (double angle bracket),
% to indicate a state vector in the ``larger'' product space $\pwspace$,
% as opposed to vectors belonging to $\hilb{H}_S$ (or $\hilb{H}_T$) only.

The ``conventional'' state $\ket{\psi(t)}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$
can be obtained from $\dket{\Psi}$ via partial inner product\footnote{
  For the partial inner product,
  see Definition \ref{def:pBra} and \ref{def:pKet},
  and \cite[\s 1.3.3]{QMT_Jacobs}.
}
with a time eigenstate $\prescript{}{T}{\bra{t}}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \ket{\psi(t)}_S = \prescript{}{T}{\bradket{t}{\Psi}} \, \text{.}
\end{equation*}
The function $ t \rightarrow \ket{\psi(t)}_S \; $ is the
``wavefunction in time representation'', in analogy
with the wavefunction in position representation of standard quantum mechanics.
The state vector $\dket{\Psi}$ is univocally identified by the ``coefficients'' $\ket{\psi(t)}_S$
with respect to the basis $\setof{\ket{t}_T}$:
\begin{equation*}
  \dket{\Psi} = \int \dd{t} \ket{t}_T \ox \ket{\psi(t)}_S \, \text{,}
\end{equation*}
somewhat similar to the well known expression $\ket{\psi}_S = \int \dd{x} \psi_{S}(x) \ket{x}_S$
which defines the position representation.

Under this time representation (or $T$ representation), the operator $\hbar\Omega$,
canonically conjugate to the time operator T, is expressed as $-i\hbar\pdv{t}$,
and the commutation relation $\comm{t, -i\hbar\pdv{t}}{} = i\hbar$ can be proven
immediately, similarly to the well known position-momentum relation.

%% \hbar\Omega is -E ... and \Omega \repr -i t-derivative ... and [T, \Omega] = i .

Using the $T$ representation in $\hilb{H}_T$,
and comparing \eqref{eq:pwHamiltonian} and \eqref{eq:Wheeler-DeWitt}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:schrod_from_pw}
  0 = \qty(\hbar\op{\Omega}\ox\idop_S + \idop_{T}\ox\op{H}_S)\dket{\Psi}
    \repr -i\hbar\pdv{t}\ket{\psi(t)}_{S} + \op{H}_S\ket{\psi(t)}_{S}
    \,\text{,}
\end{equation}
we recover the usual form of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in $H_S$
(a detailed proof can be found in \cite[709--710]{Wootters:Loyola}).

Here $\op{\Omega}$ can be seen as a ``frequency operator''
represented as $-i\pdv{t}$ and having as eigenfunctions
those functions evolving in time with a phase factor $e^{i \omega t}$ only.

Canonical commutation relation should hold and can be easily verified
between $\op{t}$ and $\op{\Omega}$
i.e. $[\op{t}, \op{\Omega}] = i$,
therefore $\hbar\op{\Omega}$ can be seen as the ``linear momentum''
in the Hilbert space of time.

From another point of view, $\hbar\op{\Omega}$ is the ``Hamiltonian'' of $\hilb{H}_T$,
in that it plays a similar role of $H_S$ in the construction of
$\op{\mathbb{J}}$ in \eqref{eq:pwHamiltonian}. Some authors (e.g. in \citereset\cite{Wootters:Loyola})
use the symbol $H_C$ (where the supscript ``$C$'' stands for ``clock'') in place of $\hbar\Omega$, to emphasize this.

Such analogies among operators in $\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$ are summarized in Table \ref{tbl:op_comparison_pw}.

% It would be interesting to a study relativistic extension of the
% Page and Wootters model that allows, for example, the derivation of the Klein-Gordon
% equation, thus eliminating the asimmetry between
% $\hilb{H}_T$ and $\hilb{H}_S$ (and momentum and energy as well).

In the bipartite universe, physical kets $\dket{\Psi}$ can have a Schmidt decomposition
made up of
eigenstates of $\op{\Omega}$ in $\hilb{H}_T$
entangled, respectively, with
eigenstates of $\op{H}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$;
or eigenstates of $\op{t}$ in $\hilb{H}_T$
entangled with time-evolved spatial states~$\ket{\psi(t)}_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$
(according to the evolution that is embedded in $\op{\mathbb{J}}$):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pw:time_freq_mu}
  \dket{\Psi} =
    \int \dd{\omega} \, \mu(\omega) \ket{\omega}_{T}\ox\ket{\phi(\omega)}_{S} =
    \int \dd{t} \, \ket{t}_{T} \ox \ket{\psi(t)}_{S} \text{.}
\end{equation}
Here $\mu(\omega)$ is a measure on the real axis which selects
values of $\omega$ such that~$\hbar\omega$ is part of the system's energy spectrum
(in ordinary quantum mechanics terms). See \cite[eq. (10)]{Lloyd:Time}.

In principle, different and less obvious decompositions are possible for other purposes.

\subsubsection{Example: eigenstate of the Hamiltonian $H_S$ in $\hilb{H}_S$}

An extreme case for the measure $\mu$ in \eqref{eq:pw:time_freq_mu}
is the evolution of an energy eigenstate
(related, say, to eigenvalue $E_0 \eqbydef -\hbar\omega_{0}$): in this case the evolution is
$\ket{\psi(t)}_{S} = \E^{\iu\hbar\omega_{0}(t-t_{0})} \ket{\psi(t_0)}_{S}$
and
the measure is
$\mu(\omega) = \delta(\omega-\omega_0)$
(it  ``selects''only $\omega_0$ among all possible values
of $\omega$).

Indeed:
\[
  \dket{\Psi} = \int \dd{\omega} \delta(\omega-\omega_0)\ket{\omega}_T \ox \ket{\phi(\omega)}_S =
    \ket{\omega_0}_T \ox \ket{\phi(\omega_0)}_S \text{.}
\]
Also, using the relations
$
\prescript{}{T}{\braket{t}{t'}}_T = \delta(t-t')
$
and
$
  \ket{\omega}_T =
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int\dd{t}\E^{\iu\omega t}\ket{t}_T
$
