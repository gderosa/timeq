\section{and dwell time}

\cite[\S 5]{TQM2}, \cite{Halliwell_DwellClocks}.

\section{In relation with the \term{time of residence}}

Here we compare \cite{Moreva:synthetic, Moreva:illustration}
(a Page and Wootters problem)
with the ``standard'' \term{time of residence}
treated in \cite[\S 5.5.2]{TQM2},
the only usable concept since there is no notion of position
for a qubit.

\section{Comparison with Kijowski/Aharonov-Bohm time of arrival}

A Page and Wootters time of arrival is mentioned in \cite{Gambini_PW}.

Time of arrival and clocks: again, \cite{Halliwell_DwellClocks}.
Which maybe suggests we should not wory too much of $H\ket{\Psi} = 0$. 

BUT please note \cite{Halliwell_DwellClocks} uses a clock that is
\emph{coupled} with the system, while in PaW they are ``only'' entangled.
So their calculation may be unnecessarily complicated.
Maybe the weakjly coupling case can be used?
