\section{and paths}

Both \cite{YearsleyHalliwell_Clocks} and \cite{Gambini_PW}
reason in terms of paths and actions, maybe Feynmann stuff
in following chapter... and maybe conistent historiesapproach can help
towards linking PaW and ToA?

Also \url{http://quantum.phys.cmu.edu/CHS/CHS_transp.pdf}.

\section{and dwell time}

\cite[\S 5]{TQM2}, \cite{YearsleyHalliwell_Clocks}.

\section{In relation with the \term{time of residence}}

Here we compare \cite{Moreva:synthetic, Moreva:illustration}
(a Page and Wootters problem)
with the ``standard'' \term{time of residence}
treated in \cite[\S 5.5.2]{TQM2},
the only usable concept since there is no notion of position
for a qubit.

\section{Comparison with (Kijowski/Aharonov-Bohm) time of arrival}

Time of arrival is derived for non-relativistic \parencite{Delgado_TOA, Delgado_TOA2}
and relativisitic \parencite{Leon_TOA_R}
particle.

Kijowski: \cite{Kijowski_Time, Kijowski_Comment}.

A Page and Wootters time of arrival is mentioned in \cite{Gambini_PW}.

Time of arrival and clocks: again, \cite{YearsleyHalliwell_Clocks}.
Which maybe suggests we should not wory too much of $H\ket{\Psi} = 0$. 

BUT please note \cite{YearsleyHalliwell_Clocks} uses a clock that is
\emph{coupled} with the system, while in PaW they are ``only'' entangled.
So their calculation may be unnecessarily complicated.
Maybe the weakjly coupling case can be used?

\section{In relation to Leggett-Garg inequalities}
(Also mentioned in \cite{Moreva_position}).

Ref \cite{LeggettGarg+PageWootters}.

But also Lloyd: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05672},
\emph{Decoherent histories approach to the cosmological measure problem}.
Lindbladt, Markov, Open Systems.

Halliwell, \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01659}. Ancilla, decay (spontaneous emission?).

A phylosophical object to decoherent histories / Everett (Everett mentioned in Marletto/ref)
is at
