\section{Density operators, projectors and measurement}

We shall assume, unless otherwise stated, that all vectors are
normalized to unity.

For a given observable represented by an operator $A$ with a
\emph{discrete, non degenerate spectrum}, the probability of the
outcome $a$ of a
measurement on a system in the pure state $\ket{\psi}$ is given by
$$
\pi_{a} = \norm{\braket{a}{\psi}}^2 
        = \bra{\psi}\ket{a}\bra{a}\ket{\psi}
        = \mel{\psi}{P_{a}}{\psi}
$$
where $P_{a} = \ketbra{a}$ appears as the \term{projector} on the
one-dimensional eigenspace of  $a$.

If $a$ is degenerate, and $j = 1, \dots, J$ its degeneracy index,
such probability shall sum over it:
$$
\pi_{a} = \sum_{j=1}^{J}\norm{\braket{aj}{\psi}}^2 
        = \sum_{j=1}^{J}\bra{\psi}\ket{aj}\bra{aj}\ket{\psi}
        = \mel{\psi}{P_{a}}{\psi}
$$
where $P_{a} = \sum_{j=1}^{J}\ketbra{aj}$
still is the projector on the
($J$-dimensional) eigenspace of $a$.

Generally, the probability that the outcome of a measuremen falls in
the set of eigenvalues $\sigma = \{a_{1}, \dots, a_{S}\}$ is
$$
\pi_{\sigma} = \sum_{s=1}^{S}\sum_{j=1}^{J_{s}}\norm{\braket{sj}{\psi}}^2 
        = \sum_{s=1}^{S}\sum_{j=1}^{J_{s}}\bra{\psi}\ket{sj}\bra{sj}\ket{\psi}
        = \mel{\psi}{P_{\sigma}}{\psi}
$$
where $P_{\sigma} = \sum_{s=1}^{S}\sum_{j=1}^{J_{s}}\ketbra{sj}$
is once again a projector --- on the ``generalized eigenspace'' spanned by all
eigenvectors $\{\ket{sj}\}$ above.
